The code you've provided doesn't seem to contain any functions, so there's nothing to document or add a @call property for. The script is importing the 'preact' module from 'index.js' file, then exporting it or binding it to the global 'self' object, which is probably the browser's 'window' object in this case. If there are any functions within this script, they are located within the imported preact module and are not visible here. Would you like to provide another script, preferably one that contains functions?
