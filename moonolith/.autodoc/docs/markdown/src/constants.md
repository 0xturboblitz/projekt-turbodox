The code provided is a class called `Const` that exports as the default export. It contains various static properties and methods that define constants used in the larger Moonolith project.

The `Const` class has several static getter methods that return constant values. For example, the `COLUMNS` getter returns the value 370, the `MARGIN_TOP` getter returns the value 650, and so on. These constants are used to define the dimensions and layout of the Moonolith project.

One important constant is `monolithHeight`, which is initially set to 0. The `LINES` getter method uses this constant, along with other margin constants, to calculate the total number of lines in the Moonolith project. The `MONOLITH_LINES` getter method simply returns the value of `monolithHeight`.

The `setMonolithHeight` method is a static setter method that allows the `monolithHeight` constant to be updated with a new value. This method can be used to dynamically adjust the height of the Moonolith project.

The class also defines several constants for colors used in the project. These constants are defined as arrays of RGB values. For example, `RGB1` represents the color black (#000000) and `RGB16` represents a shade of blue (#2f3c99). These color constants are used throughout the project to define the color palette.

The `PALETTE` constant is an array that contains all the color constants defined in the class. The `GUI_PALETTE` constant is a modified version of the `PALETTE` constant that includes an additional default color.

The `PARALLAX_LAYERS` constant is an object that defines the parallax layers used in the Moonolith project. Each layer is represented by a key-value pair, where the key is the layer index and the value is the parallax effect strength.

The `PALETTE_INFO` constant is an object that defines different configurations for the color palette display. Each configuration is represented by a key-value pair, where the key is a string identifier and the value is an object containing various properties related to the display of the color palette.

Overall, the `Const` class provides a centralized location for defining and accessing constants used in the Moonolith project. It allows for easy customization and adjustment of various aspects of the project, such as dimensions, colors, and parallax effects.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `monolithHeight` variable and how is it used in the code?
- The `monolithHeight` variable is used to determine the number of lines in the monolith. It is used in the calculation of the `LINES` and `MONOLITH_LINES` properties.

2. What is the purpose of the `MARGIN_TOP`, `MARGIN_BOTTOM`, `MARGIN_LEFT`, and `MARGIN_RIGHT` properties?
- These properties define the margins of the monolith. They are used in the calculation of the `LINES` and `MONOLITH_COLUMNS` properties.

3. What is the purpose of the `PALETTE_INFO` object and how is it used in the code?
- The `PALETTE_INFO` object contains information about different palettes. It is used to define the offset, spacing, and other properties of each palette.
