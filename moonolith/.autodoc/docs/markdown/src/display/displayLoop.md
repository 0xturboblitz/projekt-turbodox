The code provided is a part of the Moonolith project and is responsible for initializing and updating the display of the game. 

The `initDisplay()` function is the entry point of the code. It initializes the canvas element, loads images, GUI elements, and animations, and starts the update loop using the `requestAnimationFrame()` function. The update loop continuously updates the image, animation, and GUI catalogs, animates the monolith if the intro state is false, clears the canvas, and then draws the layers, monolith, and GUI elements on the canvas. The `update()` function is called recursively using `requestAnimationFrame()` to create a smooth animation effect.

The `drawLayer()` function is a helper function that is responsible for drawing the images and animations for a specific layer on the canvas. It is called multiple times in the `update()` function to draw different layers.

The `drawMonolith()` function is responsible for drawing the monolith on the canvas. It calculates the height of the monolith display based on the intro state and the view position. It then creates an image data object for the monolith and sets its data using the `cutMonolith()` function. Finally, it positions the monolith on the canvas and draws it using the `putImageData()` method.

The `cutMonolith()` function is a helper function that extracts a portion of the monolith data based on the monolith display height and the intro state. It calculates the start and end coordinates for the monolith data array and returns the extracted portion.

The `shake()` function is responsible for shaking the landscape images and changing the view position. It toggles the rumble sound effect, shakes the landscape images by randomly changing their shakeX property, and changes the view position by randomly changing the viewPosX and viewPosY variables. After a certain duration, it clears the shake effects and toggles the rumble sound effect again.

The `initCanvas()` function is responsible for creating and initializing the canvas element. It creates a canvas element, appends it to the document body, sets its dimensions and style, and adds a resize manager function to handle window resizing.

Overall, this code is crucial for initializing and updating the display of the Moonolith game. It loads and draws images, animations, and GUI elements, animates the monolith, handles shaking effects, and manages the canvas element.
## Questions: 
 **Question 1:** What is the purpose of the `initDisplay` function?

**Answer:** The `initDisplay` function initializes the display by loading images, GUI, and animations, and then continuously updates the display by calling the `update` function.

**Question 2:** What does the `drawMonolith` function do?

**Answer:** The `drawMonolith` function draws the monolith on the canvas based on the current view position and the monolith display height.

**Question 3:** What is the purpose of the `shake` function?

**Answer:** The `shake` function shakes the landscapes by randomly changing their X position and also shakes the view position. It also clears the shake effect after a certain duration.
