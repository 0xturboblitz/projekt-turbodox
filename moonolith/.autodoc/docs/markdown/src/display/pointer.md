The code provided is a function called `addPointer` that is used to modify a `monolithData` array based on the current `tool` and `deviceType`. The `monolithData` array represents the data of a monolith, which is a display or canvas-like object in the larger Moonolith project. The purpose of this code is to add a pointer or cursor to the monolithData array, which will be used to interact with the monolith.

The function first checks if the `deviceType` is "mobile". If it is, the function simply returns the `monolithData` array without making any modifications. This suggests that the code is handling different behavior for mobile devices.

Next, the code checks the value of the `tool` variable. Depending on the value, different modifications are made to the `monolithData` array. The `tool` variable represents the size of the pointer or cursor being used. The possible values for `tool` are "smol", "medium", "large", and "giga".

For each tool size, the code uses nested for loops to iterate over a range of values around the current position of the pointer. The `whiten` function is called for each position within the range, passing in the `monolithData` array and the coordinates of the position. The `whiten` function modifies the `monolithData` array based on the position.

After the nested loops, the code returns the modified `monolithData` array.

The `whiten` function is a helper function that is used to modify the `monolithData` array at a specific position. It first checks if the position is within the bounds of the `renderWidth` and `renderHeight` variables. If it is not, the function returns without making any modifications.

Next, the function converts the position to `monolithPos` using the `convertToMonolithPos` function. If the `monolithPos` is falsy, meaning it is not on the monolith, the function returns without making any modifications.

Finally, the function calculates the index of the position in the `monolithData` array using the `monolithPos` and `Const.MONOLITH_COLUMNS`. If the value at that index in the `monolithIndexes` array is greater than 0, the function returns without making any modifications.

If all the checks pass, the function modifies the `monolithData` array at the calculated index by adding a fraction of the difference between 255 and the current value at that index. This effectively lightens the color at that position.

In summary, the `addPointer` function is used to add a pointer or cursor to the `monolithData` array based on the current `tool` and `deviceType`. The `whiten` function is used to modify the `monolithData` array at a specific position by lightening the color. This code is likely part of a larger project that involves interacting with a monolith display or canvas.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `addPointer` function?
- The `addPointer` function is used to modify the `monolithData` array based on the `tool` and `pointer` values.

2. What does the `whiten` function do?
- The `whiten` function checks if a given position on the `monolithData` array is editable and then modifies the RGB values at that position to make it whiter.

3. What are the conditions for skipping the execution of the `whiten` function?
- The `whiten` function is skipped if the position is outside the render width and height, if the position is not on the monolith, or if the position is not editable.
