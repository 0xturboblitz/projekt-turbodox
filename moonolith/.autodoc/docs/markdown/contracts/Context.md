The provided code is written in Solidity, a programming language used for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum. This specific code defines an abstract contract named `Context`. 

The `Context` contract provides information about the current execution context. This includes the sender of the transaction and its data. The contract contains two internal functions: `_msgSender()` and `_msgData()`. 

The `_msgSender()` function returns the address of the entity (account or contract) that triggered the current function execution. This is typically accessed via `msg.sender` in Solidity, but this function provides a layer of abstraction to prevent direct access.

The `_msgData()` function returns the complete calldata, which is a non-modifiable, non-persistent area where function arguments are stored, and can be used within the function. This is typically accessed via `msg.data` in Solidity, but again, this function provides a layer of abstraction.

These functions are particularly useful when dealing with meta-transactions, where the account sending and paying for execution may not be the actual sender. By using these functions, the contract ensures a consistent interface for accessing this information, regardless of the underlying transaction details.

Here's an example of how these functions might be used:

```solidity
contract MyContract is Context {
    function doSomething() public {
        address sender = _msgSender();
        bytes memory data = _msgData();
        // ... (use sender and data)
    }
}
```

In this example, `MyContract` inherits from `Context` and can use `_msgSender()` and `_msgData()` to access the transaction's sender and data in a safe, abstracted way.
