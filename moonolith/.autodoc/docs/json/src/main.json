  "summary": "The code in this file primarily handles the initialization and dynamic updates of a web application, presumably a visual display of a monolith structure. \n\nThe `initApp` function is the main entry point. It sets up the application's state and decides whether to launch an intro sequence or skip it based on the `firstTime` and `Opensea` variables. The `setRoute` function is used to parse the URL and set the `Opensea` and `runeNumber` variables, and also sets a cookie to track if the user has visited the site before.\n\nThe `chunkImport` and `importNewChunks` functions are responsible for fetching and processing \"chunks\" of data, which are then displayed on the monolith. These chunks are fetched from a Web3-based source, as indicated by the imported `getChunk`, `getMetaData`, and `getAllChunks` functions from `./utils/web3`. The chunks are then processed and displayed on the monolith using the `bufferOnMonolith` function.\n\nThe `setMonoHeightAndBuildIt` function fetches metadata, calculates the height of the monolith based on this metadata, and then builds the monolith using the `buildMonolith` function. It also initializes some visual elements with the `initClouds` function.\n\nThe code also sets up a recurring interval to call `importNewChunks` every 30 seconds, ensuring that the monolith display is kept up-to-date with the latest data.\n\n```javascript\nsetInterval(() => {\n    importNewChunks();\n}, 30000);\n```\n\nOverall, this code is responsible for initializing the application, fetching and processing data to be displayed on the monolith, and updating this display at regular intervals.",
