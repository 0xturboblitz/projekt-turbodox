  "summary": "The code provided is a part of the Moonolith project and is responsible for building and manipulating a monolith. The monolith is represented as a two-dimensional array of pixels, where each pixel has a position, color, and zIndex. The code provides functions for building the monolith, drawing pixels, getting the color of a pixel, erasing all pixels, and increasing the height of the monolith.\n\nThe `buildMonolith` function initializes the monolith array with default colors for each pixel. It creates a Uint8ClampedArray with a size of `Const.MONOLITH_LINES * Const.MONOLITH_COLUMNS * 4`, where each pixel is represented by four values (RGBA). The function then sets the initial color values for each pixel in the monolith array.\n\nThe `drawPixel` function is responsible for drawing a pixel at a given position with a specified zIndex and color. It first checks if the position is within the bounds of the monolith. If it is not, the function returns. It then checks if the pixel at the given position is editable based on its current zIndex. If it is not editable, the function returns. Next, it checks if the new pixel has the same position, zIndex, and color as the existing pixel. If they are the same, the function returns. If the pixel is currently being animated, the function returns. If the pixel is being drawn by the user (zIndex = 0), it adds the current pixel color to the undo stack. \n\nThe function then determines the transition type based on the zIndex. If the zIndex is 0, the transition type is 'draw'. If the zIndex is undefined, the transition type is 'erase'. If the zIndex corresponds to a chunk of animated pixels, the transition type is 'import'. If the transition type is 'draw' or 'erase', the function sets the pixel in the animatedPixels map with the transition type, color, and duration. If the transition type is 'import', it adds the pixel position and color to the data array of the corresponding chunk in the chunksToAnimateInfo map. If the transition type is undefined, it sets the color of the pixel directly in the monolith array.\n\nThe function then updates the zIndex of the pixel in the monolithIndexes array. If the zIndex is 0, it plays a sound effect. If the zIndex is undefined, it plays a different sound effect.\n\nThe `getColor` function returns the color of a pixel at a given position in the monolith array.\n\nThe `eraseAllPixel` function iterates over all pixels in the monolith and calls the `drawPixel` function to erase each pixel by setting its color to the default color. It then closes the current event and plays a sound effect.\n\nThe `increaseMonolithHeight` function increases the height of the monolith by a specified number of rows. It creates a new Uint8ClampedArray with a larger size to accommodate the additional rows. It copies the existing monolith array into the new array and sets the default color values for the new rows. It then updates the monolith and monolithIndexes variables with the new array and adds undefined values for the zIndex of the new rows in the monolithIndexes array.\n\nThe function then schedules a series of timeouts to gradually increase the height of the monolith. It uses a logarithmic scaling value to control the delay between each increase in height. After the specified delay, it calls a function to update the height of the monolith.\n\nFinally, the function calls the `shake` function to animate the monolith.\n\nOverall, this code provides the functionality to build, draw, erase, and manipulate a monolith in the Moonolith project. It is an essential component of the larger project, allowing users to interact with and modify the monolith.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `buildMonolith` function?**\nThe `buildMonolith` function initializes the `monolith` and `monolithIndexes` arrays with default values based on the constants defined in the `Const` module.\n\n2. **What is the significance of the `zIndex` parameter in the `drawPixel` function?**\nThe `zIndex` parameter determines the layering of the pixel being drawn. A lower `zIndex` value means the pixel will be drawn on top of pixels with higher `zIndex` values.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `increaseMonolithHeight` function?**\nThe `increaseMonolithHeight` function increases the height of the `monolith` and `monolithIndexes` arrays by adding new rows. It also triggers a visual effect and animation to simulate the growth of the monolith."
