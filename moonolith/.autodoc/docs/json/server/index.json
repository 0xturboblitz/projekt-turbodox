  "summary": "This HTML file serves as the basic structure for a web page in the Moonolith project. The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration at the top of the file is used to inform the web browser about the version of HTML the page is written in. The `<html lang=\"en\">` tag specifies that the language of this document is English.\n\nThe `<head>` section contains meta-information about the document. The `<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">` tag specifies the character encoding for the web page, which is UTF-8. The `<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=11\" />` tag is used to define the document compatibility mode in IE 11. The `<meta http-equiv=\"Cache-Control\" content=\"no-cache\" />` tag is used to prevent the browser from caching the document.\n\nThe `<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" content=\"default-src 'self'; style-src 'self';\" />` tag is used to control resources the user agent is allowed to load, providing a measure of protection against cross-site scripting attacks. It restricts all the sources to be loaded from the same origin ('self').\n\nThe `<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">` tag is used for responsive web design. It sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device), and the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.\n\nThe `<title>` tag defines the title of the document, which is 'sender de liste v1.0'. This title is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.\n\nThe `<body>` tag contains the content of the document. In this case, it is currently empty. This is where the main content of the web page would be added.",
