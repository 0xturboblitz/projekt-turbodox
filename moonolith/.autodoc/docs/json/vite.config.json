  "summary": "This code is a configuration file for Vite, a modern front-end build tool. It is written in JavaScript and uses ES6 import syntax to import necessary modules. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to define specific configurations for the Vite server and module resolution. The `defineConfig` function from Vite is used to export a configuration object. This object has two properties: `server` and `resolve`.\n\nThe `server` property is an object that contains configurations for the Vite development server. In this case, the `hmr` (Hot Module Replacement) property is set to `false`. This means that when a file is changed, the whole page will reload instead of just the changed module.\n\nThe `resolve` property is an object that contains configurations for module resolution. The `alias` property is used to define a shortcut for importing modules. In this case, the '@' symbol is mapped to the path of the 'src' directory. This allows developers to import modules from the 'src' directory using '@' instead of the relative path. For example, instead of writing `import MyComponent from '../../src/MyComponent'`, they can write `import MyComponent from '@/MyComponent'`.\n\nThe `fileURLToPath` and `URL` modules from the 'url' package are used to convert the URL of the 'src' directory to a file path. The `import.meta.url` property is a built-in feature in JavaScript modules that provides the URL of the current module.",
