The `SafeMath` library in this Solidity code provides a set of functions for performing mathematical operations with built-in overflow and underflow checks. These checks are crucial in preventing common bugs in smart contracts that could be exploited by attackers. 

The library includes functions for addition (`tryAdd`, `add`), subtraction (`trySub`, `sub`), multiplication (`tryMul`, `mul`), division (`tryDiv`, `div`), and modulus (`tryMod`, `mod`). Each operation has a `try` version that returns a boolean flag indicating whether the operation was successful, along with the result. This allows developers to handle potential errors in a more granular way.

For example, `tryAdd(uint256 a, uint256 b)` attempts to add `a` and `b` together. If the operation overflows, it returns `false` and `0`. If it doesn't overflow, it returns `true` and the result of the addition.

The non-`try` versions of the functions (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `mod`) revert the transaction if an overflow or underflow occurs. This is a more drastic way of handling errors, but it ensures that transactions cannot result in an invalid state.

The library also includes versions of `sub`, `div`, and `mod` that accept a custom error message. These are deprecated because they require unnecessary memory allocation for the error message.

In the larger project, this library would be used wherever mathematical operations are performed to ensure that these operations do not result in overflows or underflows.
