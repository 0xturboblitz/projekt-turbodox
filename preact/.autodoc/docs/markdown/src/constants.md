The code provided in this file defines three constants: `EMPTY_OBJ`, `EMPTY_ARR`, and `IS_NON_DIMENSIONAL`. These constants are likely to be used throughout the Preact project.

The `EMPTY_OBJ` constant is an empty object literal. It can be used as a placeholder or default value when an empty object is needed. For example, it can be used as a default value for an optional parameter in a function:

```javascript
function myFunction(options = EMPTY_OBJ) {
  // ...
}
```

The `EMPTY_ARR` constant is an empty array literal. Similar to `EMPTY_OBJ`, it can be used as a placeholder or default value when an empty array is needed. For example, it can be used as a default value for an optional parameter in a function:

```javascript
function myFunction(items = EMPTY_ARR) {
  // ...
}
```

The `IS_NON_DIMENSIONAL` constant is a regular expression pattern. It is likely used to match strings that represent non-dimensional CSS properties. The pattern is case-insensitive and matches various CSS properties such as `grid`, `rows`, `zoo`, `order`, `iterator`, etc. This constant can be used to determine if a given CSS property is non-dimensional. For example:

```javascript
const property = 'grid';
if (IS_NON_DIMENSIONAL.test(property)) {
  console.log(`${property} is a non-dimensional CSS property.`);
} else {
  console.log(`${property} is not a non-dimensional CSS property.`);
}
```

Overall, this code provides essential constants that can be used throughout the Preact project. The `EMPTY_OBJ` and `EMPTY_ARR` constants can be used as default values for optional parameters, while the `IS_NON_DIMENSIONAL` constant can be used to identify non-dimensional CSS properties.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EMPTY_OBJ` and `EMPTY_ARR` constants?
- The `EMPTY_OBJ` constant is an empty object, and the `EMPTY_ARR` constant is an empty array. They are likely used as default values or placeholders in the code.

2. What does the regular expression `IS_NON_DIMENSIONAL` match?
- The `IS_NON_DIMENSIONAL` regular expression matches various strings related to non-dimensional CSS properties. It is likely used for some kind of CSS-related functionality in the code.

3. What is the significance of the `/acit|ex(?:s|g|n|p|$)|rph|grid|ows|mnc|ntw|ine[ch]|zoo|^ord|itera/i` pattern in the `IS_NON_DIMENSIONAL` regular expression?
- The pattern represents a combination of strings that are likely non-dimensional CSS properties. The `i` flag at the end indicates that the regular expression is case-insensitive.
