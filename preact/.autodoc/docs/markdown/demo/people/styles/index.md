This code is a part of a larger project called Preact. It is responsible for importing and styling various SCSS files, defining CSS variables, and setting global styles for the application.

The code begins by importing several SCSS files using the `@import` directive. These files likely contain styles specific to different components or sections of the application, such as the app itself, animations, avatars, profiles, and buttons.

Next, the code defines CSS variables using the `:root` selector. These variables are used to define colors, sizes, and other properties that can be reused throughout the application. For example, `--app-background` defines the background color of the app, `--app-primary` defines the primary color, and `--spinner-size` defines the size of a spinner element.

The code then sets global styles for all elements using the `*` selector. The `box-sizing` property is set to `border-box`, which ensures that the width and height of an element includes its padding and border. This prevents elements from overflowing their containers. 

Next, the code sets styles for the `#people-app` element, which is likely the main container for the application. The `display` property is set to `flow-root`, which establishes a new block formatting context and prevents margin collapsing. The `overflow` property is set to `auto`, which adds scrollbars when the content overflows the container. The `min-height` property is set to `100vh`, which ensures that the container takes up at least the full height of the viewport. The `margin` property is set to `0`, which removes any margin around the container. The `animation` property is set to `background-light 5s ease-out forwards`, which applies a background animation to the container. Finally, the `background` property is set to a series of radial and linear gradients, creating a fancy background effect.

The code also sets styles for the `.spinner` class within the `#people-app` element. This class is likely used to display a loading spinner. The `position` property is set to `absolute`, which positions the spinner relative to its closest positioned ancestor. The `top` and `left` properties are used to center the spinner horizontally and vertically within the container. The `width` and `height` properties are set to the value of the `--spinner-size` variable, which determines the size of the spinner. The `animation` property is set to `zoom 250ms 500ms forwards ease-out`, which applies a zoom animation to the spinner. The `opacity` property is set to `0`, which initially hides the spinner. The `transition` property is set to `opacity 200ms, transform 200ms ease-in`, which adds a smooth transition effect when the spinner is shown or hidden.

The code also defines keyframes for the `spinner` animation. This animation is applied to the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements of the spinner. The keyframes define different transformations and rotations at different percentages of the animation duration, creating a spinning effect.

Finally, the code sets some additional styles for `ul`, `ol`, and `a` elements within the `#people-app` container. These styles remove the default padding and list-style for lists, and set the color and text-decoration for links.

Overall, this code is responsible for importing and styling various SCSS files, defining CSS variables, and setting global styles for the Preact application. It provides a consistent and visually appealing look and feel for the entire application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `@import` statements at the beginning of the code? 
   - The `@import` statements are used to import external SCSS files into the current file, allowing the styles defined in those files to be used in the current file.

2. What is the purpose of the `--app-` CSS custom properties defined within the `#people-app` selector? 
   - The `--app-` CSS custom properties are used to define reusable values for colors, sizes, and other styles that can be used throughout the `#people-app` element and its descendants.

3. What is the purpose of the `.spinner` and `.spinner.exit` selectors within the `#people-app` selector? 
   - The `.spinner` and `.spinner.exit` selectors are used to style elements with the class "spinner" that are descendants of the `#people-app` element. The `.spinner.exit` selector is used to apply additional styles to the spinner element when it is being exited or removed from the DOM.
