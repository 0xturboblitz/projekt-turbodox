This code defines three different keyframe animations: `popup`, `zoom`, and `appear-from-left`. Keyframe animations allow for the creation of complex animations by specifying a series of keyframes and the properties that should be applied at each keyframe.

The `popup` animation is used to create a popup effect. It starts with a box shadow and opacity of 0, and a scale of 0.9. As the animation progresses, the box shadow becomes more pronounced, the opacity increases to 1, and the scale returns to its original value of 1.

The `zoom` animation is used to create a zoom effect. It starts with an opacity of 0 and a scale of 0.8. As the animation progresses, the opacity increases to 1 and the scale returns to its original value of 1.

The `appear-from-left` animation is used to create an appearance effect from the left side of the screen. It starts with an opacity of 0 and a translation of -25px on the x-axis. As the animation progresses, the opacity increases to 1 and the translation returns to its original value of 0.

These keyframe animations can be used in conjunction with CSS selectors to apply the animations to specific elements on a webpage. For example, the `popup` animation could be applied to a modal window to create a smooth transition when the modal is displayed. The `zoom` animation could be applied to an image to create a zoom-in effect when the image is hovered over. The `appear-from-left` animation could be applied to a navigation menu to create a sliding-in effect when the menu is opened.

Overall, this code provides a set of reusable keyframe animations that can be used to enhance the visual experience of a webpage. By defining these animations in a separate file, they can be easily referenced and applied to different elements throughout the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `popup` keyframe animation?
- The `popup` keyframe animation is used to create a pop-up effect by gradually increasing the box shadow, opacity, and scale of an element.

2. What does the `zoom` keyframe animation do?
- The `zoom` keyframe animation is used to gradually increase the opacity and scale of an element, creating a zoom-in effect.

3. What effect does the `appear-from-left` keyframe animation create?
- The `appear-from-left` keyframe animation gradually increases the opacity and translates an element from left to right, creating an appearance effect.
