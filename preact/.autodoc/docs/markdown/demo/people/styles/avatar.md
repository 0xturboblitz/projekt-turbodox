This code is a CSS stylesheet that defines the styling for an avatar component in a web application. The avatar component is used to display a small image or icon that represents a user or a profile picture.

The code is written using CSS selectors and properties. The `#people-app` selector targets an element with the id "people-app", which is likely the container element for the avatar component. The `.avatar` selector targets any element with the class "avatar" that is a descendant of the element with the id "people-app".

The CSS properties within the `.avatar` selector define the visual appearance of the avatar component. Here is a breakdown of each property:

- `display: inline-block;`: This property sets the display behavior of the avatar component to be an inline block element. This allows other elements to be displayed next to it horizontally.

- `overflow: hidden;`: This property hides any content that exceeds the dimensions of the avatar component. This is useful if the avatar image is larger than the specified width and height.

- `width: var(--avatar-size, 32px);` and `height: var(--avatar-size, 32px);`: These properties set the width and height of the avatar component. The values are defined using CSS variables, which allow for dynamic sizing based on the value of the `--avatar-size` variable. If the variable is not defined, the default value of 32px is used.

- `background-color: var(--avatar-color, var(--app-primary));`: This property sets the background color of the avatar component. It uses another CSS variable, `--avatar-color`, to define the color. If the variable is not defined, it falls back to the value of `--app-primary`, which is likely a global variable defined elsewhere in the project.

- `border-radius: 50%;`: This property sets the border radius of the avatar component to create a circular shape.

- `font-size: calc(var(--avatar-size, 32px) * 0.5);`: This property sets the font size of the text inside the avatar component. It uses the same `--avatar-size` variable to calculate the font size as half of the avatar size.

- `line-height: var(--avatar-size, 32px);`: This property sets the line height of the text inside the avatar component to be the same as the avatar size. This ensures that the text is vertically centered within the component.

- `object-fit: cover;`: This property specifies how the avatar image should be resized to fit within the component. The "cover" value scales the image to cover the entire component while maintaining its aspect ratio.

- `text-align: center;`: This property centers the text horizontally within the avatar component.

- `text-transform: uppercase;`: This property transforms the text inside the avatar component to uppercase.

- `white-space: nowrap;`: This property prevents the text inside the avatar component from wrapping to the next line.

Overall, this code defines the visual styling for an avatar component in a web application. It allows for dynamic sizing, customizable colors, and ensures that the text is properly aligned and formatted within the component. This code can be used in the larger project by applying the "avatar" class to the appropriate elements that need to display avatars. For example:

```html
<div id="people-app">
  <div class="avatar">
    <img src="avatar.jpg" alt="User Avatar">
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, the avatar component is used within a container element with the id "people-app". The avatar image is specified using an `<img>` tag within the avatar component. The CSS styles defined in the code will be applied to the avatar component, resulting in the desired visual appearance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `people-app` ID selector? 
- The `people-app` ID selector is used to target a specific element in the HTML markup with the ID of `people-app` and apply CSS styles to it.

2. What is the purpose of the `avatar` class selector? 
- The `avatar` class selector is used to target elements with the class of `avatar` and apply CSS styles to them. It is likely used to style avatar images or elements in the application.

3. What are the values of the CSS custom properties `--avatar-size`, `--avatar-color`, and `--app-primary`? 
- The values of these CSS custom properties are not provided in the given code snippet. They are likely defined elsewhere in the CSS or HTML code and determine the size, color, and primary color of the avatars in the `people-app`.
