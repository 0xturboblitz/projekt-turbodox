This code is a CSS stylesheet that defines the styling for a component called "profile" in the Preact project. The "profile" component is used to display information about a person, such as their name, avatar, and other details.

The code starts by targeting an element with the ID "people-app" and then defines the styles for the "profile" class within that element. This allows the styles to be applied specifically to the "profile" component within the "people-app" element.

The "profile" class is set to have a display of flex, which means that its child elements will be laid out in a flexible box model. The flex-flow property is set to "column", which means that the child elements will be stacked vertically. The align-items property is set to "center", which means that the child elements will be centered horizontally within the "profile" component. The margin property is set to create a 32px margin on the top and bottom of the "profile" component.

There is also an animation property that applies an animation called "appear-from-left" to the "profile" component. This animation lasts for 0.5 seconds and plays forwards, meaning that it will play once and then stop at the final state.

The "--avatar-size" variable is defined with a value of 80px. This variable can be used within the "profile" component to set the size of the avatar element.

The "h2" element within the "profile" component is styled to have its text transformed to capitalize the first letter of each word.

The "details" class within the "profile" component is set to have a display of flex, which means that its child elements will be laid out in a flexible box model. The flex-flow property is set to "column", which means that the child elements will be stacked vertically. The align-items property is set to "stretch", which means that the child elements will stretch to fill the available space horizontally. The margin property is set to create a 16px margin on the top and bottom of the "details" component.

The "p" elements within the "details" component are styled to have a margin of 8px on the top and bottom.

Overall, this code defines the styling for the "profile" component in the Preact project. It sets the layout and appearance of the component, allowing it to be used to display information about a person in a visually appealing way.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `animation` property in the `.profile` class?**
The `animation` property is used to apply the `appear-from-left` animation to the `.profile` element, causing it to animate in from the left side over a duration of 0.5 seconds.

2. **What is the purpose of the `--avatar-size` variable?**
The `--avatar-size` variable is used to define the size of the avatar image within the `.profile` element. It is likely used to ensure consistent sizing across different instances of the `.profile` class.

3. **What is the purpose of the `align-items: stretch;` property in the `.profile .details` class?**
The `align-items: stretch;` property is used to stretch the child elements of the `.details` class to fill the available vertical space within the parent `.profile` element. This ensures that the child elements are evenly spaced vertically.
