The purpose of this code is to provide a convenient way to render or hydrate a Preact component into a specified root DOM element.\n\nThe `createRoot` function takes in a single parameter `rootDom`, which is expected to be an HTML element. It returns an object with two methods: `render` and `hydrate`. These methods can be used to render or hydrate a Preact component into the specified `rootDom` element.\n\nThe `render` method takes a single parameter `vnode`, which is a JSX element representing the Preact component to be rendered. It uses the `render` function from the `preact` library to render the `vnode` into the `rootDom` element.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `render` method:\n\n```javascript\nimport { createRoot } from 'preact';\n\nconst rootElement = document.getElementById('root');\nconst { render } = createRoot(rootElement);\n\nconst App = () => (\n  <div>\n    <h1>Hello, Preact!</h1>\n  </div>\n);\n\nrender(<App />);\n```\n\nThe `hydrate` method is similar to the `render` method, but it is used when the server has already rendered the initial HTML and the client needs to take over and make the page interactive. It uses the `hydrate` function from the `preact` library to hydrate the `vnode` into the `rootDom` element.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `hydrate` method:\n\n```javascript\nimport { createRoot } from 'preact';\n\nconst rootElement = document.getElementById('root');\nconst { hydrate } = createRoot(rootElement);\n\nconst App = () => (\n  <div>\n    <h1>Hello, Preact!</h1>\n  </div>\n);\n\nhydrate(<App />);\n```\n\nIn summary, this code provides a convenient way to render or hydrate a Preact component into a specified root DOM element. It abstracts away the usage of the `render` and `hydrate` functions from the `preact` library, making it easier to use Preact in a project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

These modules are used to handle file paths and URLs. \n\nNext, the code imports two functions, `preinstall` and `postinstall`, from the `../preact-local-proxy/scripts.mjs` file. These functions are defined in another file and are responsible for executing pre-installation and post-installation scripts specific to the Preact project.\n\nThe `__dirname` variable is then defined using the `path.dirname` function and the `fileURLToPath` function. This variable represents the directory name of the current module file.\n\nThe `pkgRoot` function is defined as a helper function that takes in any number of arguments and joins them together using the `path.join` function. It uses the `__dirname` variable as the starting point and appends the provided arguments to create a file path.\n\nFinally, the `preinstall` and `postinstall` functions are exported. These functions call the `localPreinstall` and `localPostInstall` functions respectively, passing in the `pkgRoot` function and a string as arguments.

It allows for a more concise and readable way of using the `render` and `hydrate` functions. By calling `createRoot` with the `rootDom` element, you can destructure the returned object to get the `render` and `hydrate` methods directly.

These functions are used to support the installation of a local build from either a tarball or the root package.json file.\n\nThe `preinstall` function takes three parameters: `pkgRoot`, `prefix`, and `preactLocalTgz`. The `pkgRoot` parameter is a function that returns the path to the package root directory. The `prefix` parameter is a string that is used as a prefix for log messages. The `preactLocalTgz` parameter is the path to the `preact-local.tgz` file. \n\nThe purpose of the `preinstall` function is to check if the `preact-local.tgz` file exists. If it does, it updates the `preact-local-proxy/package.json` file to point to that tarball. If the file does not exist, it leaves the `preact-local-proxy/package.json` file unmodified, which by default points to the root package.json file. This feature is necessary to support the CI benchmarks of the project, where the prebuilt `.tgz` file is copied to each job to avoid rebuilding.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `preinstall` function:\n\n```javascript\nimport { preinstall } from 'preact';\n\npreinstall();\n```\n\nThe `postinstall` function also takes two parameters: `pkgRoot` and `prefix`. It performs the post-installation steps after the package has been installed. The purpose of this function is to reset the `preact` dependency back to the local build from the root package.json file. This is done by modifying the `package.json` file and setting the `preact` dependency to `'file:../../../'`.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `postinstall` function:\n\n```javascript\nimport { postinstall } from 'preact';\n\npostinstall();\n```\n\nOverall, these functions are used to handle the installation and post-installation steps of the Preact project.

If it does, it updates the `preact-local-proxy/package.json` file to install that tarball. If it doesn't exist, it leaves the `preact-local-proxy/package.json` file unmodified.\n\n**Question 2:** What is the purpose of the `postinstall` function?\n\n**Answer:** The `postinstall` function is responsible for resetting the `preact` dependency back to a local build after the benchmark installation is complete.

These functions are used to process the benchmark logs and extract relevant performance metrics. \n\nThe `getStatsFromLogs` function is the main function responsible for processing the logs. It takes in the version of the framework, an array of log file paths, and optional functions for extracting thread IDs and filtering events. It reads the log files, parses them as JSON, and iterates over the logs to extract relevant data. It uses the helper functions `addToGrouping`, `addToMapArray`, and `setInMapArray` to aggregate the data into a map structure. Finally, it returns a map of performance statistics for each metric.\n\nThe `analyze` function is the entry point of the code. It first checks if the log directory exists and if there are any benchmark logs available. If not, it displays an error message and exits.

It uses the `globSrc` function from the `utils.js` module to find the benchmark files that match the specified patterns. If no benchmarks are found, it logs a message indicating that no benchmarks were found. Otherwise, it logs a message indicating the benchmarks that will be run.\n\nNext, the function generates a configuration file for each benchmark using the `generateConfig` function from the `config.js` module. The configuration file is generated based on the benchmark path and the options provided. The `prepare` option is set to `true` for the first benchmark configuration, indicating that the prepare script should only be run for the first configuration.\n\nAfter generating the configuration files, the function creates a directory for the benchmark results using the `mkdir` function from the `fs/promises` module.\n\nThen, the function iterates over the generated configuration files and runs the benchmarks using the `spawnSync` function from the `child_process` module.

It takes a `benchFile` parameter representing the file name of the benchmark and an `opts` parameter representing additional options. It first resolves the path to the benchmark file using the `benchesRoot` function. It then checks if the resolved path is a file using the `stat` function. If it is not a file, an error is thrown.

If a single framework is specified, only that framework is included. If an array of frameworks is specified, only those frameworks are included. It then checks if each framework is valid using the `isValid` method. If a framework is not valid, a warning message is logged and the framework is skipped.

It first determines the path to the configuration file using the `configDir` function. It then creates the directory if it does not exist and writes the configuration object to the file.\n\nThe `parseBrowserOption` function is defined to parse the browser option string and return a browser configuration object. It extracts the remote URL if present and removes the \"-headless\" suffix if present. It then creates a configuration object with the browser name, headless flag, and remote URL if present. Additional custom options are set for the Chrome browser.\n\nOverall, this code is responsible for generating a configuration file for running benchmarks using the Tachometer library.

These options include the framework to be tested (`preact-local`), the timeout duration (5 seconds), and whether to open the results in a browser (true if not running in a CI environment).\n\nThe code also defines a function `getResultDir` which takes a benchmark name and a framework name as input and returns the path to the directory where the results of the v8-deopt-viewer tool will be stored.\n\nNext, the code defines an async function `runPackage` which takes a package name, an array of arguments, and an optional `stdio` parameter. This function uses the `getPkgBinPath` function to get the path to the binary file of the specified package, prepends it to the array of arguments, and then spawns a child process using `spawn` to run the package with the provided arguments.\n\nThe code also defines an async function `onExit` which takes a child process as input and returns a promise that resolves when the child process exits.

This function returns a promise that resolves with an array of TachURL objects. This function listens for the stdout data of the Tachometer process and searches for URLs in the output. It uses regular expressions to match lines containing benchmark names and framework names, and extracts the corresponding URLs. Once all URLs are found, the promise is resolved with the array of TachURL objects.\n\nThe code also defines a function `createPrefixTransform` which takes a prefix string as input and returns a Transform stream. This stream is used to add a prefix to each line of data that passes through it. This function is used to create streams that add prefixes to the stdout and stderr of the v8-deopt-viewer process.\n\nThe code then defines an async function `runV8DeoptViewer` which takes a TachURL object and a DeoptOptions object as input. This function creates a directory for storing the v8-deopt-viewer output, constructs the arguments for running the v8-deopt-viewer tool, spawns a child process to run the tool with the arguments, and pipes the stdout and stderr of the child process through the prefix transform streams. Finally, the function waits for the child process to exit using the `onExit` function.\n\nThe code also defines an async function `runDeopts` which takes a benchmark glob pattern and a DeoptOptions object as input. This function first checks if a benchmark glob pattern is provided and sets a default pattern if not. It then retrieves the path to the first matched benchmark file using the `globSrc` function. The function generates a Tachometer config object using the `generateConfig` function, passing the benchmark path and the default benchmark and deopts options. The function then runs the Tachometer process in manual mode with the generated config, parses the URLs from the Tachometer output using the `getTachometerURLs` function, and runs the v8-deopt-viewer tool for each URL using the `runV8DeoptViewer` function. Finally, the function handles cleanup by killing the Tachometer process and waiting for it to exit.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to run benchmarks for the Preact framework using Tachometer and analyze the performance using the v8-deopt-viewer tool. It automates the process of running benchmarks, capturing URLs from the Tachometer output, and running the v8-deopt-viewer tool for each URL. This code is likely used as part of a larger project for performance testing and optimization of the Preact framework.\n## Questions: \n 1.

These interfaces are used to define the options and configurations for two different functionalities within the larger Preact project.\n\nThe `TachometerOptions` interface is used to configure the Tachometer tool, which is a performance benchmarking tool. It has the following properties:\n\n- `browser`: A string or an array of strings representing the browser(s) to be used for benchmarking. This allows the user to specify which browser(s) they want to test the performance on.\n- `framework`: A string or an array of strings representing the framework(s) to be benchmarked. This allows the user to specify which framework(s) they want to test the performance of.\n- `window-size`: A string representing the size of the browser window during benchmarking. This allows the user to simulate different screen sizes and test the performance under different conditions.\n- `sample-size`: A number representing the number of samples to be taken during benchmarking. This allows the user to control the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark results.\n- `horizon`: A string representing the time horizon for the benchmark. This allows the user to specify the duration for which the benchmark should run.\n- `timeout`: A number representing the maximum time allowed for each benchmark to complete. This allows the user to set a timeout for each benchmark, preventing them from running indefinitely.\n- `trace`: A boolean value indicating whether or not to enable tracing during benchmarking. This allows the user to collect additional performance data for analysis.\n\nThe `DeoptOptions` interface is used to configure the Deopt tool, which is a tool for detecting and analyzing deoptimizations in JavaScript code. It has the following properties:\n\n- `framework`: A string representing the framework to be analyzed for deoptimizations. This allows the user to specify which framework they want to analyze.\n- `timeout`: A number representing the maximum time allowed for the analysis to complete. This allows the user to set a timeout for the analysis, preventing it from running indefinitely.\n- `open`: A boolean value indicating whether or not to open the analysis results in a browser. This allows the user to view the analysis results directly in a browser.\n\nThese interfaces provide a way for users of the Preact project to customize and configure the Tachometer and Deopt tools according to their specific needs and requirements. By defining these options, the code allows users to fine-tune the benchmarking and analysis processes, enabling them to gather accurate performance data and detect potential deoptimizations in their Preact applications.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `TachometerOptions` interface?**\nThe `TachometerOptions` interface is used to define the options that can be passed to the Tachometer tool.

It then reads the contents of the proxy packages directory using the `readdir` function from the `fs/promises` module. The resulting array of directory names is then mapped to remove the \"-proxy\" suffix from each name.\n\nNext, the function iterates over each framework in the input `frameworks` array. For each framework, it checks if there is a corresponding directory in the proxy packages directory. If there is no matching directory, the function continues to the next framework.\n\nIf a matching directory is found, the function defines a helper function called `proxyDir` that returns the path to the specific proxy package directory for the current framework.\n\nThe function then checks if the proxy package has a `scripts.mjs` file using the `existsSync` function from the `fs` module. If the file exists, it is imported and the `preinstall` function is called if it exists.\n\nNext, the function deletes the `package-lock.json` file and the `node_modules` folder from the proxy package directory using the `deleteAsync` function from the `del` module. This is done to ensure that the latest packages are always installed.\n\nAfter cleaning the directory, the function runs the `npm i` command using the `execFileSync` function from the `child_process` module. This command installs the dependencies for the proxy package.\n\nIf the proxy package has a `scripts.mjs` file, it is imported again and the `postinstall` function is called if it exists.\n\nIn summary, the `prepare` function prepares proxy packages for a list of frameworks by cleaning the package directory, installing the latest packages, and running pre and post-install scripts if they exist. This function is likely used as part of a larger project to set up the necessary dependencies for running benchmarks or tests on different frameworks.\n## Questions: \n 1.

These trace events are used for performance profiling and debugging purposes in the larger Preact project.\n\nThe `TraceEvent` type is a union type that represents all possible types of trace events. Each trace event type is defined as an interface that extends the `BaseEvent` interface. The `BaseEvent` interface defines common properties that are present in all trace events, such as the event name, event categories, event type, timestamps, process ID, thread ID, and event arguments.\n\nSome of the trace event types include:\n- `DurationEvent`: Represents the beginning or end of a duration of work on a given thread. It includes additional properties for stack frame and stack data.\n- `CompleteEvent`: Represents a duration of work on a given thread. It includes additional properties for the duration of the event, stack frame at the end of the event, and stack at the end of the event.\n- `InstantEvent`: Represents an event that happened but has no duration associated with it. It can have stack data associated with it.\n- `AsyncEvent`: Represents asynchronous operations, such as frames in a game or network I/O. It includes properties for the start, instant, and end of the event, as well as an ID and scope.\n- `FlowEvent`: Represents events that visually link two duration events together using lines and arrows. It includes properties for the flow type.\n\nThese trace events can be used in the larger Preact project for various purposes, such as performance profiling, debugging, and analyzing the execution flow of the application. Developers can instrument their code with these trace events to capture and analyze the timing and sequence of events during the execution of the application.\n\nHere's an example of how these trace events can be used in the Preact project:\n\n```typescript\nimport { DurationEvent, CompleteEvent } from 'Preact';\n\nfunction performWork() {\n  const startEvent: DurationEvent = {\n    name: 'Work',\n    cat: 'Performance',\n    ph: 'B',\n    ts: performance.now(),\n    pid: 123,\n    tid: 456,\n    args: {}\n  };\n\n  // Perform some work...\n\n  const endEvent: CompleteEvent = {\n    name: 'Work',\n    cat: 'Performance',\n    ph: 'E',\n    ts: performance.now(),\n    pid: 123,\n    tid: 456,\n    dur: performance.now() - startEvent.ts,\n    args: {}\n  };\n\n  // Emit the trace events for analysis\n  emitTraceEvent(startEvent);\n  emitTraceEvent(endEvent);\n}\n\nfunction emitTraceEvent(event: TraceEvent) {\n  // Emit the trace event for analysis\n  console.log(event);\n}\n\nperformWork();\n```\n\nIn this example, the `performWork` function represents a piece of work that needs to be profiled. It creates a `DurationEvent` at the beginning of the work and a `CompleteEvent` at the end of the work. These events are then emitted using the `emitTraceEvent` function for analysis.\n## Questions: \n **Question 1:** What are the different types of events that can be traced in this code?\n\n**Answer:** The different types of events that can be traced in this code include DurationEvent, CompleteEvent, InstantEvent, AsyncEvent, FlowEvent, SampleEvent, ProcessNameEvent, ProcessLabelsEvent, ProcessSortIndexEvent, ThreadNameEvent, ThreadSortIndexEvent, MarkEvent, ContextEvent, ObjectCreatedEvent, ObjectSnapshotEvent, and ObjectDestroyedEvent.\n\n**Question 2:** What are the common properties shared by all events?\n\n**Answer:** The common properties shared by all events include name (string), cat (string), ph (string), ts (number), pid (number), tid (number), and args (Record<string, any>).\n\n**Question 3:** What is the purpose of the StackData interface and how is it used in the code?\n\n**Answer:** The StackData interface is used to represent stack frame and stack information at the start of an event. It is used in DurationEvent and CompleteEvent interfaces to provide stack-related data for these events.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/benches/scripts/tracing.d.md"}}],["13",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/benches/scripts/utils.js)\n\nThe code provided is a module that contains various utility functions and constants used in the Preact project. Let's break down the code and explain its purpose and usage in the larger project.\n\n1. Import Statements:\n   - The code imports several functions and modules from external libraries such as `url`, `fs/promises`, `path`, `escalade`, and `globby`. These libraries provide functionality for working with file paths, file system operations, and glob pattern matching.\n\n2. IS_CI Constant:\n   - The `IS_CI` constant is a boolean value that indicates whether the code is running in a continuous integration (CI) environment.

It uses the `path.join()` function to concatenate the root directory path with the provided arguments.\n\n4. benchesRoot and resultsPath Constants:\n   - The `benchesRoot` constant is a function similar to `repoRoot` but specifically for paths within the \"benches\" directory of the project.\n   - The `resultsPath` constant is a function similar to `benchesRoot` but specifically for paths within the \"results\" directory of the project.\n\n5. toUrl Function:\n   - The `toUrl` function takes a string as input and replaces any protocol prefix (e.g., \"http:\", \"https:\") with a forward slash (\"/\") and replaces any backslashes (\"\\\") with forward slashes (\"/\"). This function is used to convert file paths to URL paths.\n\n6. allBenches Constant:\n   - The `allBenches` constant is a string pattern that matches all HTML files in the project. It is used as a default pattern for glob pattern matching.\n\n7. globSrc Function:\n   - The `globSrc` function takes an array of glob patterns as input and uses the `globby` function from the `globby` library to match files in the \"src\" directory of the \"benches\" directory. It returns a promise that resolves to an array of matched file paths.\n\n8. getPkgBinPath Function:\n   - The `getPkgBinPath` function takes a package name as input and retrieves the path to the binary file associated with that package.\n   - It first tries to resolve the package using `require.resolve()` and then searches for the nearest \"package.json\" file using the `escalade` function from the `escalade` library.\n   - If the package cannot be resolved or a \"package.json\" file is not found, it falls back to a default path within the \"node_modules\" directory of the project.\n   - It checks if the resolved \"package.json\" file exists and contains a \"bin\" entry. If not, it throws an error.\n   - It constructs the path to the binary file using the directory of the \"package.json\" file and the \"bin\" entry.\n   - Finally, it checks if the binary file exists and returns the path.\n\nOverall, this code provides utility functions and constants for working with file paths, glob pattern matching, and package management in the Preact project. These functions can be used in various parts of the project to perform file system operations, resolve package paths, and convert file paths to URL paths.\n## Questions: \n 1.

These utility functions are used for measuring performance, testing element text, and executing code after a frame is rendered. The `framework` module is imported from the Preact library, and the `render` function from the `keyed-children` module is imported.\n\nThe `render` function is then called with the `framework` module and the `main` function is passed as a callback to be executed after a frame is rendered. The `main` function is an asynchronous function that performs the main logic of the application.\n\nIn the `main` function, a CSS selector is defined to select the first cell of the first row in a table. The code then enters a loop that runs `WARMUP_COUNT` times. In each iteration, the `run` function is called, which triggers the rendering and updating of the table. After each run, the `afterFrameAsync` function is awaited to ensure that the frame is rendered before proceeding. The `testElementText` function is then called to check if the text in the selected element matches the expected value based on the iteration count.\n\nAfter the warmup loop, the `afterFrameAsync` function is awaited again to ensure that the frame is rendered. Then, the `afterFrame` function is called with a callback function. In this callback function, the `testElementText` function is called again to check if the text in the selected element matches the expected value based on the warmup count. Performance markers are also set to measure the time it takes to render the table and the memory usage is measured using the `measureMemory` function.\n\nFinally, the `markRunStart` function is called to set a performance marker for the final run, the `start` performance marker is set, and the `run` function is called again. After the final run, the `markRunEnd` function is called to set a performance marker for the end of the final run.\n\nOverall, this code sets up the necessary environment for a Preact application, imports utility functions and modules, defines a main function that performs the rendering and updating of a table, and sets up performance measurements.

It then includes a head section that sets the character encoding, viewport settings, and a title for the page. Additionally, it includes a meta tag for description and some CSS styles.\n\nThe body of the HTML file contains a single div element with the id \"main\". This is where the Preact component will be rendered.\n\nThe JavaScript code starts with several import statements. It imports various utility functions and objects from a file called \"util.js\" and the entire \"framework\" module. It also imports the \"render\" function from a file called \"keyed-children/index.js\".\n\nThe code then uses the imported \"render\" function to mount the Preact component onto the div element with the id \"main\". The \"mount\" function is called without any arguments, indicating that the component should be rendered with its initial state.\n\nNext, there is a function called \"repeat\" that takes a pattern and a number of repeats as arguments. It returns a string that repeats the pattern the specified number of times. This function is used later in the code to generate a string with multiple exclamation marks.\n\nThe code then defines two asynchronous functions: \"init\" and \"run\". The \"init\" function is responsible for initializing the Preact component and performing some initial tests. It calls the \"mount\" function to render the component, waits for the next frame using the \"afterFrameAsync\" function, and then performs a test on an element using the \"testElement\" function.\n\nAfter that, there is a loop that runs three times. In each iteration, the \"update\" function is called to trigger a partial update of the component. After waiting for the next frame, another test is performed on an element using the \"testElementTextContains\" function. The test checks if the text of the element contains a repeated pattern of exclamation marks, with the number of repetitions increasing in each iteration.\n\nThe \"run\" function is similar to the \"init\" function, but it measures the performance of the partial update using the \"performance\" API. It marks the start and stop points, measures the time elapsed between them, and calls the \"measureMemory\" function to measure memory usage.\n\nFinally, the \"init\" function is called followed by the \"run\" function, ensuring that the initialization is completed before running the performance measurement.\n\nIn summary, this code demonstrates how to perform a partial update of a web page using the Preact framework.

This function is called during the warmup run to ensure that the initial rendering is correct.\n\nThe `clickRemove` function simulates a click on the remove link of the second row in the table and verifies that the number of rows before and after the click is as expected. This function is called during the warmup run to test the functionality of removing rows.\n\nThe `warmupRun` function performs a warmup run of the application. It sets up the hydrate root, verifies the initial state of the application, clicks the remove link, and verifies the state after the removal. This function is called multiple times in a loop during the warmup phase.\n\nThe `timedRun` function is the main function that measures the performance and memory usage of the application. It sets up the hydrate root, creates a new store, and hydrates the root with the `Main` component. Performance and memory measurements are taken before and after the hydration process.\n\nFinally, the `main` function is called, which runs the warmup phase and then the timed run. The warmup phase is repeated five times to ensure that the application is properly warmed up before the performance measurements are taken.\n\nIn summary, this code sets up a Preact application, hydrates a table with 1,000 rows, and measures the performance and memory usage of the application. It demonstrates the usage of Preact's rendering and state management capabilities and provides insights into the performance characteristics of the application.\n## Questions: \n 1.

These classes are used to create components in the Preact project.\n\nThe `Row` class is a component that represents a row in a table. It takes in props such as `data`, `styleClass`, `onClick`, and `onDelete`. The `shouldComponentUpdate` method is implemented to determine if the component should update based on changes in the props. The `onDelete` and `onClick` methods are event handlers that are called when the corresponding actions are triggered. The `render` method generates the HTML structure for the row using the `createElement` function provided as an argument.\n\nThe `Main` class is the main component of the project. It takes in a `store` prop, which is an instance of the `Store` class imported from another file. The `Main` component has various methods such as `run`, `add`, `update`, `select`, `delete`, `runLots`, `clear`, and `swapRows` that manipulate the `store` object and update the component's state accordingly. The `render` method generates the HTML structure for the main component, including a table with rows generated from the `store` data.\n\nThe `getComponents` function is the entry point of the module. It takes in an object with properties `createElement` and `Component`, which are dependencies injected from the Preact framework. It returns an object with the `Main` and `Row` classes as properties.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger Preact project to create and render components. For example, in the project's entry file, the `getComponents` function can be called to get the `Main` and `Row` classes, which can then be used to create and render components in the application. Here's an example of how it can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { getComponents } from 'Preact';\n\nconst { Main, Row } = getComponents(preact);\n\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Main store={store} />\n      <Row data={rowData} onClick={handleClick} onDelete={handleDelete} styleClass=\"row-class\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\n// Render the App component to the DOM\npreact.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Main` component is rendered with a `store` prop, and the `Row` component is rendered with `data`, `onClick`, `onDelete`, and `styleClass` props. These components can be customized and used in various parts of the application to display data and handle user interactions.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of the `store` parameter in the `Main` class constructor?\n- The `store` parameter is used to initialize the `state` property of the `Main` class with a `store` object. If `store` is not provided, a new instance of `Store` is used.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `swapRows` method in the `Main` class?\n- The `swapRows` method is called to swap the positions of two rows in the `store` data. It updates the `state` property of the `Main` class and triggers a re-render.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/benches/src/keyed-children/components.md"}}],["20",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/benches/src/keyed-children/index.js)\n\nThe purpose of this code is to render a Preact application on a specified root DOM element and return an object with various methods for interacting with the rendered application.\n\nThe `render` function takes two parameters: `framework` and `rootDom`. The `framework` parameter is an object that represents the Preact framework and contains three properties: `createElement`, `createRoot`, and `Component`. The `rootDom` parameter is the root DOM element where the Preact application will be rendered.\n\nThe function first imports the `getComponents` function from a file called `components.js`. This function is not shown in the provided code, but it is likely responsible for retrieving the necessary components for the Preact application.\n\nNext, the `Main` component is extracted from the result of calling `getComponents` with the `framework` object. The `Main` component is then passed to the `render` method of the `createRoot` function, which is called with the `rootDom` element. This renders the Preact application on the specified root DOM element.\n\nAfter rendering the application, the function retrieves the `app` object from the global `window` object. This object is assumed to have certain methods, such as `run`, `add`, `update`, etc. These methods are then bound to the `app` object and returned as an object.\n\nThe returned object can be used to interact with the rendered Preact application. For example, the `run` method can be called to execute a specific action in the application, the `add` method can be used to add new elements, the `update` method can be used to update existing elements, and so on.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `render` function:\n\n```javascript\nimport Preact from 'preact';\n\nconst rootDom = document.getElementById('root');\n\nconst framework = {\n  createElement: Preact.createElement,\n  createRoot: Preact.createRoot,\n  Component: Preact.Component\n};\n\nconst appMethods = render(framework, rootDom);\n\nappMethods.run();\nappMethods.add('New Element');\nappMethods.update(1, 'Updated Element');\n// ...\n```\n\nIn this example, the Preact application is rendered on the `rootDom` element using the specified `framework`.

What is the purpose of the `getComponents` function and how does it relate to the `Main` component?\n- The `getComponents` function is imported from the `components.js` file and it returns an object that includes the `Main` component. The `Main` component is then used in the `render` function to create the root element.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `framework.createRoot(rootDom).render(framework.createElement(Main))` line?\n- This line is responsible for rendering the `Main` component into the specified `rootDom` element using the `createElement` and `createRoot` methods provided by the `framework` object.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `app` object and how is it used in the return statement?\n- The `app` object is a reference to the `Main` component instance. In the return statement, various methods of the `app` object are bound to their respective functions and returned as an object. This allows external code to interact with the `Main` component through these bound methods.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/benches/src/keyed-children/index.md"}}],["21",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/benches/src/keyed-children/store.js)\n\nThe code provided is a part of the Preact project and defines a class called `Store`. The purpose of this class is to manage and manipulate a collection of data items. \n\nThe `Store` class has several methods that allow for various operations on the data. \n\nThe `buildData` method generates an array of data items with a specified count. It uses three arrays (`adjectives`, `colours`, and `nouns`) to randomly generate a label for each data item. The label is created by selecting a random adjective, colour, and noun from the respective arrays. The generated data items are then stored in the `data` property of the `Store` instance.\n\nThe `updateData` method updates the label of every 10th data item in the `data` array. It appends the string \"!!!\" to the existing label of each selected data item.\n\nThe `delete` method removes a data item from the `data` array based on its id. It uses the `findIndex` method to find the index of the data item with the specified id and then uses the `splice` method to remove it from the array.\n\nThe `run` method initializes the `data` property by calling the `buildData` method with a default count of 1000. It also sets the `selected` property to `undefined`.\n\nThe `add` method adds 1000 new data items to the `data` array by concatenating the result of calling the `buildData` method with a count of 1000 to the existing `data` array.\n\nThe `update` method updates the labels of every 10th data item in the `data` array by calling the `updateData` method.\n\nThe `select` method sets the `selected` property to the specified id.\n\nThe `runLots` method initializes the `data` property by calling the `buildData` method with a count of 10000. It also sets the `selected` property to `undefined`.\n\nThe `clear` method empties the `data` array and sets the `selected` property to `undefined`.\n\nThe `swapRows` method swaps the second and 999th data items in the `data` array if the array has more than 998 items.\n\nOverall, the `Store` class provides methods for generating, updating, deleting, and manipulating a collection of data items. It can be used in the larger project to manage and manipulate data in a Preact application.\n## Questions: \n 1.

These functions are not defined in the provided code, but they are likely utility functions used for measuring performance and memory usage.\n\nNext, the code imports two functions, `createRoot` and `createElement`, from a library called 'framework'. These functions are used to create a root element and create HTML elements, respectively. The specific implementation of the 'framework' library is not provided in the code.\n\nThe code then defines a `state` object that contains a `msg` property set to 'hello' and a `list` property set to an array of 1000 objects. Each object in the `list` array has an `i` property set to its index and a `text` property set to 'foobar' concatenated with its index.\n\nAfter that, a `counter` variable is defined and initialized to 0. The `App` function is then defined, which returns a Preact element tree. The element tree consists of a `div` element with an `id` of 'app', two `p` elements, and a dynamic number of `div` elements generated from the `state.list` array. The `state.msg` property is used to set the class name of some elements, and the `state.msg` and `i` values are used to set the `title` attribute of some elements.\n\nA root element is created using the `createRoot` function and the `render` method is called on it with the `App` function as the argument. This renders the initial element tree to the `div` element with the `id` of 'root'.\n\nThe code then defines a `runPatch` function, which updates the `state.msg` and `state.list[0].text` properties and re-renders the element tree using the `root.render` method. This function is called multiple times in the `warmup` function, which is an asynchronous function that runs the `runPatch` function 25 times with a delay of one animation frame between each call.\n\nAfter the `warmup` function, the code measures the performance and memory usage of the `runPatch` function. The `performance.mark`, `performance.measure`, and `measureMemory` functions are used to measure the time it takes to execute the `runPatch` function and the memory usage during its execution.\n\nIn summary, this code demonstrates how to use the Preact library to create and update HTML elements.

This new function is used as an event handler and is responsible for updating the state of the application by calling `rerender` with the updated state.\n\nThe code then defines several mutation functions: `add`, `setText`, `toggle`, and `remove`. These functions are used to update the state of the application in response to user actions. For example, the `add` function is called when the user submits a form to add a new ToDo item. It takes the current state, increments a counter, and adds a new item to the `todos` array.\n\nThe code also defines two functional components: `TodoItem` and `App`. The `TodoItem` component represents a single ToDo item and renders a list item with a checkbox, text, and a delete button.

If the `promise` is null, a new promise is created and returned. When the callback is executed, the `promise` is set back to null and the resolved time is returned.\n\nThe `measureMemory` function is exported and is used to measure the memory usage of the browser. It first checks if the necessary APIs (`gc` and `memory`) are available in the `window` and `performance` objects. If they are available, it performs a garbage collection (`window.gc()`) and measures the memory usage before and after the garbage collection. It then waits for a \"major task\" to complete before marking the end of the measurement. The memory usage is then calculated and stored in the `window.usedJSHeapSize` property.\n\nThe `markRunStart` function is exported and is used to mark the start of a run or operation. It uses the `performance.mark` method to create a performance mark with a unique identifier based on the provided `runId`.\n\nThe `markRunEnd` function is exported and is used to mark the end of a run or operation.

These functions are used in the Preact project to create and manage the rendering of components in a web application.\n\nThe `createRoot` function takes a `container` parameter, which represents the DOM element where the components will be rendered. It returns an object with two methods: `render` and `unmount`. The `render` method is responsible for rendering the provided `children` components into the `container` element using the `render` function from the `preact/compat` module. The `unmount` method is used to unmount and remove the components from the `container` element using the `unmountComponentAtNode` function from the same module.\n\nHere's an example of how `createRoot` can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { createRoot } from 'preact';\n\nconst container = document.getElementById('app');\nconst root = createRoot(container);\n\nroot.render(<App />); // Render the App component into the container\n\n// Later, when the component needs to be unmounted\nroot.unmount(); // Unmount and remove the component from the container\n```\n\nThe `hydrateRoot` function is similar to `createRoot`, but it is specifically used for server-side rendering (SSR). It takes the `container` and `children` parameters, where `children` represents the components to be rendered. It uses the `hydrate` function from the `preact/compat` module to hydrate the components into the `container` element. Hydration is the process of attaching event listeners and other necessary data to the server-rendered HTML. After hydrating, it returns the same object as `createRoot`.\n\nHere's an example of how `hydrateRoot` can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'preact';\n\nconst container = document.getElementById('app');\nconst root = hydrateRoot(container, <App />); // Hydrate the App component into the container\n\n// Later, when the component needs to be unmounted\nroot.unmount(); // Unmount and remove the component from the container\n```\n\nIn summary, this code provides functions for creating and managing the rendering of components in a Preact application. The `createRoot` function is used for client-side rendering, while the `hydrateRoot` function is used for server-side rendering. These functions simplify the process of rendering and unmounting components in a Preact application, making it easier to build interactive and dynamic web interfaces.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `createRoot` function?**\nThe `createRoot` function is used to create a root component that can be rendered into a specified container.

It is responsible for importing and exporting two important dependencies: `preact/compat` and `preact/jsx-runtime`.\n\nThe `preact/compat` module is a compatibility layer that allows developers to use the latest version of Preact while still maintaining compatibility with older versions of React. This module provides a set of APIs that mimic the behavior of React, allowing developers to write code that is compatible with both Preact and React. This is particularly useful for projects that are migrating from React to Preact or for projects that need to support both libraries simultaneously.\n\nHere is an example of how the `preact/compat` module can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { render } from 'preact/compat';\nimport { useState } from 'preact/hooks';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nrender(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\n```\n\nThe `preact/jsx-runtime` module is responsible for providing the necessary runtime support for JSX syntax in Preact applications. It includes the necessary functions and utilities to transform JSX syntax into function calls that create and update Preact components.\n\nHere is an example of how the `preact/jsx-runtime` module can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { h, render } from 'preact/jsx-runtime';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Preact!</h1>;\n}\n\nrender(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\n```\n\nIn this example, the `h` function is used to create a virtual DOM element, and the `render` function is used to render the `App` component into the DOM.\n\nOverall, this module plays a crucial role in the Preact project by providing compatibility with React and enabling the use of JSX syntax in Preact applications. It allows developers to write code that is familiar to React developers and facilitates the migration from React to Preact.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `require('preact/compat')` statement?**\nThe `require('preact/compat')` statement is used to import the compatibility layer of the Preact library, which allows Preact components to be used in a React environment.\n\n2. **Why is `module.exports` set to `require('preact/jsx-runtime')`?**\n`module.exports` is set to `require('preact/jsx-runtime')` in order to export the JSX runtime of the Preact library, which is responsible for transforming JSX syntax into function calls.\n\n3. **What is the overall role of this code within the Preact project?**\nThis code is responsible for setting up the necessary dependencies and exports for using Preact in a project, specifically the compatibility layer and the JSX runtime.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/compat/jsx-dev-runtime.md"}}],["28",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/compat/jsx-runtime.js)\n\nThe code provided is a module that is part of the Preact project. The purpose of this module is to import and export two other modules: `preact/compat` and `preact/jsx-runtime`.\n\nThe `preact/compat` module is responsible for providing compatibility with older versions of Preact and other React-like libraries. It allows developers to write code using the latest Preact features and APIs, while still being able to run that code on older versions of Preact or other libraries that have a similar API. This module is typically used when developers want to ensure that their code works across different versions of Preact or other libraries.\n\nHere is an example of how the `preact/compat` module can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { render } from 'preact/compat';\nimport App from './App';\n\nrender(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\n```\n\nIn this example, the `render` function from the `preact/compat` module is used to render the `App` component into the DOM. This code will work with both older and newer versions of Preact.\n\nThe `preact/jsx-runtime` module is responsible for providing the necessary runtime support for JSX syntax in Preact. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript files. The `preact/jsx-runtime` module ensures that JSX code can be transformed into valid JavaScript code that Preact can understand and render.\n\nHere is an example of how the `preact/jsx-runtime` module can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { h, Fragment } from 'preact/jsx-runtime';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Fragment>\n      <h1>Hello, Preact!</h1>\n      <p>Welcome to the Preact project.</p>\n    </Fragment>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `h` function and `Fragment` component from the `preact/jsx-runtime` module are used to define the `App` component. The JSX code within the `return` statement is transformed into valid JavaScript code using the `preact/jsx-runtime` module.\n\nOverall, this module plays a crucial role in the Preact project by providing compatibility with older versions of Preact and other libraries, as well as enabling the use of JSX syntax in Preact applications.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `require('preact/compat')` statement?**\n   The `require('preact/compat')` statement is used to import the compatibility layer of the Preact library, which allows Preact components to be used in a React environment.\n\n2. **Why is `module.exports` set to `require('preact/jsx-runtime')`?**\n   `module.exports` is set to `require('preact/jsx-runtime')` to export the JSX runtime of the Preact library, which is responsible for transforming JSX syntax into function calls.\n\n3. **Are there any other dependencies required for this code to work?**\n   Based on the given code, it is unclear if there are any other dependencies required for this code to work.

It states that the file controls protected/private property mangling to ensure consistent property names in minified builds. It also explains that most properties are only used on one type of objects, so they can have the same name without causing collisions, which helps reduce the size of the minified builds.\n\nThe \"minify\" section contains the configuration for property mangling. It has a nested \"mangle\" object, which further contains a \"properties\" object. The \"properties\" object specifies the rules for mangling properties. \n\nThe \"regex\" property in the \"properties\" object is a regular expression that defines the pattern for matching property names that should be mangled. In this case, it matches property names that start with an underscore followed by any character except another underscore.\n\nThe \"reserved\" property in the \"properties\" object is an array of property names that should not be mangled.

These constants are named `unstable_ImmediatePriority`, `unstable_UserBlockingPriority`, `unstable_NormalPriority`, `unstable_LowPriority`, and `unstable_IdlePriority`. These constants can be used to specify the priority level when calling the `unstable_runWithPriority` function.\n\nLastly, the module exports a function called `unstable_now`. This function is a reference to the `performance.now` function, which is a method provided by the browser's `performance` object. The `performance.now` function returns a high-resolution timestamp, allowing for precise timing measurements. By binding the `performance.now` function to the `unstable_now` function, it can be easily accessed and used throughout the project.\n\nOverall, this module provides a way to schedule and prioritize tasks, as well as access a high-resolution timestamp for timing purposes.

It is also exporting an object with two properties, `renderToString` and `renderToStaticMarkup`, which are assigned the values of the `renderToString` function.\n\nThe `preact-render-to-string` module is a utility that allows rendering Preact components to a string representation. This is useful for server-side rendering (SSR) or generating static HTML files.\n\nThe `renderToString` function takes a Preact component as input and returns a string representation of the rendered component. This can be used to generate HTML on the server and send it to the client, improving performance and SEO.

This API provides several utility functions for working with child elements in Preact components.\n\nThe `mapFn` function is a helper function that takes two arguments: `children` and `fn`. It first checks if the `children` argument is null or undefined, and if so, it returns null. Otherwise, it converts the `children` argument into an array of child elements using the `toChildArray` function from the `preact` module. It then applies the `fn` function to each child element in the array using the `map` method, and finally converts the resulting array back into a child element array using the `toChildArray` function.\n\nThe `Children` object is then defined as an export, and it contains several methods:\n\n- `map`: This method is a passthrough to the `mapFn` function. It takes two arguments: `children` and `fn`, and it returns the result of calling `mapFn` with these arguments.\n\n- `forEach`: This method is also a passthrough to the `mapFn` function. It takes two arguments: `children` and `fn`, and it returns the result of calling `mapFn` with these arguments.\n\n- `count`: This method takes a single argument `children` and returns the number of child elements in the `children` argument. It first converts the `children` argument into an array of child elements using the `toChildArray` function, and then returns the length of the resulting array.\n\n- `only`: This method takes a single argument `children` and returns the only child element in the `children` argument. It first converts the `children` argument into an array of child elements using the `toChildArray` function, and then checks if the length of the resulting array is not equal to 1. If it is not equal to 1, it throws an error. Otherwise, it returns the first element in the array.\n\n- `toArray`: This method is a passthrough to the `toChildArray` function from the `preact` module. It takes a single argument `children` and returns an array of child elements.\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to work with child elements in Preact components. It allows developers to map over child elements, count the number of child elements, retrieve the only child element, and convert child elements into an array. These utility functions can be used in various scenarios where manipulation of child elements is required, such as rendering lists or conditionally rendering child elements based on certain conditions.\n## Questions: \n 1.

If there is not exactly one child, it throws an error.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/compat/src/Children.md"}}],["34",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/compat/src/PureComponent.js)\n\nThe code provided defines a `PureComponent` class that extends the `Component` class from the `preact` library. This `PureComponent` class is designed to have a predefined implementation of the `shouldComponentUpdate` method.\n\nThe `shouldComponentUpdate` method is a lifecycle method in React and Preact that determines whether a component should re-render or not. By default, this method returns `true`, indicating that the component should always re-render when its props or state change. However, in some cases, re-rendering a component can be expensive and unnecessary if the new props or state are the same as the previous ones. In such cases, implementing a custom `shouldComponentUpdate` method can improve performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.\n\nThe `PureComponent` class in this code provides a convenient way to create components that only re-render when their props or state have changed. It achieves this by comparing the current props and state with the new props and state passed to the `shouldComponentUpdate` method. If there is a difference between the current and new props or state, the method returns `true`, indicating that the component should re-render. Otherwise, it returns `false`, indicating that the component should not re-render.\n\nThe `PureComponent` class also sets a property `isPureReactComponent` to `true`. This property is used by some third-party libraries to identify if a component is a pure component or not.\n\nHere's an example of how the `PureComponent` class can be used in a larger project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { h, render } from 'preact';\nimport { PureComponent } from './PureComponent';\n\nclass MyComponent extends PureComponent {\n  render() {\n    return <div>{this.props.text}</div>;\n  }\n}\n\nconst root = document.getElementById('root');\nrender(<MyComponent text=\"Hello, World!\" />, root);\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyComponent` class extends the `PureComponent` class. Since `MyComponent` is a pure component, it will only re-render if the `text` prop changes. This can improve performance in scenarios where `MyComponent` is frequently re-rendered but the `text` prop remains the same.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `shallowDiffers` function imported from './util'?\n   - **Answer:** The `shallowDiffers` function is used to compare the differences between two objects by performing a shallow comparison of their properties.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `PureComponent` class differ from the `Component` class imported from 'preact'?\n   - **Answer:** The `PureComponent` class is a subclass of the `Component` class and has a predefined `shouldComponentUpdate` implementation that checks for differences in props and state using the `shallowDiffers` function.\n\n3. **Question:** Why is the `isPureReactComponent` property set to `true` on the `PureComponent.prototype`?\n   - **Answer:** The `isPureReactComponent` property is set to `true` on the `PureComponent.prototype` to indicate to third-party libraries that this component is a pure React component and has a predefined `shouldComponentUpdate` implementation.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/compat/src/PureComponent.md"}}],["35",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/compat/src/forwardRef.js)\n\nThe code provided is a part of the Preact project and it defines a function called `forwardRef`. This function is used to pass a ref down to a child component. It is mainly used in libraries with Higher-Order Components (HOCs) that wrap components. \n\nThe `forwardRef` function takes a function `fn` as a parameter. This function is responsible for rendering the wrapped component. Inside the `forwardRef` function, a new function called `Forwarded` is defined. This function takes the `props` as a parameter and creates a clone of the props object. It then deletes the `ref` property from the clone and calls the `fn` function with the clone and the original `ref` value as arguments. This allows the wrapped component to receive the ref.\n\nThe `Forwarded` function is then modified to add some properties that are expected by other libraries, such as `mobx-react`. The `$$typeof` property is set to a symbol that represents the `react.forward_ref` feature. This is used by `mobx-react` to check if a component is a forwarded ref component. The `render` property is set to the `Forwarded` function itself, which is used by `mobx-react` to access the wrapped component's render method. The `isReactComponent` property is set to `true` and the `_forwarded` property is also set to `true`. These properties are used by `mobx-react` to determine if a component is a forwarded ref component.\n\nFinally, the `displayName` property of the `Forwarded` function is set to a string that includes the display name of the `fn` function. This is used for debugging purposes and to provide a meaningful name for the forwarded ref component.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to create a forwarded ref component in Preact. It allows the ref to be passed down to the wrapped component, which is useful in libraries that use HOCs to wrap components. The additional properties added to the `Forwarded` function ensure compatibility with other libraries, such as `mobx-react`.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `options._diff` function and how does it modify the `vnode` object?\n- The `options._diff` function is used to modify the `vnode` object. It checks if the `vnode` has a type that is forwarded and a ref, and if so, it assigns the ref to the `vnode.props.ref` and sets `vnode.ref` to null.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `REACT_FORWARD_SYMBOL` constant and how is it determined?\n- The `REACT_FORWARD_SYMBOL` constant is used to check if the `Symbol.for('react.forward_ref')` symbol is available.

On the other hand, the `export as namespace React;` statement is declaring the `React` object as the namespace for the module, allowing the code to access the exported members using the `React` namespace.\n\n**Question 3:** What is the purpose of the `unstable_batchedUpdates` function?\n\n**Answer:** The `unstable_batchedUpdates` function is used to batch multiple updates to the UI, reducing the number of re-renders and improving performance. It takes a callback function as an argument and executes it within a batched update context.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/compat/src/index.d.md"}}],["37",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/compat/src/index.js)\n\nThe code provided is a module that exports various functions, classes, and constants related to the Preact library. Preact is a lightweight alternative to React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\n\nThe module imports several functions and classes from the 'preact' and 'preact/hooks' modules, as well as from other custom modules within the Preact project. It also imports constants and functions from the 'render' module.\n\nThe module exports all the imported functions, classes, and constants, as well as some additional functions and classes defined within the module itself.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the key components and their purposes:\n\n- `createElement`: This function is imported from the 'preact' module and is used to create virtual DOM elements. It is used extensively throughout the Preact library to create and render components.\n\n- `render` and `hydrate`: These functions are imported from the 'render' module and are used to render Preact components into the DOM. `render` is used for initial rendering, while `hydrate` is used for server-side rendering.\n\n- `cloneElement`: This function is a wrapper around the `preactCloneElement` function from the 'preact' module. It is used to clone a Preact element, applying any additional props or children.\n\n- `unmountComponentAtNode`: This function is used to unmount a Preact component from the DOM. It removes the component's state and event handlers.\n\n- `findDOMNode`: This function is used to get the corresponding DOM node for a Preact component.\n\n- `useSyncExternalStore`: This function is a custom implementation of a hook that synchronizes an external store with a Preact component. It takes a `subscribe` function and a `getSnapshot` function as arguments. The `subscribe` function is called whenever the external store changes, and the `getSnapshot` function returns the current value of the external store. The hook updates the component whenever the value of the external store changes.\n\n- Other functions and classes: The module also exports various other functions and classes that are used in Preact, such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useContext`, `useDebugValue`, `Fragment`, `Component`, `PureComponent`, `memo`, `forwardRef`, `Suspense`, `SuspenseList`, `lazy`, etc.\n\nOverall, this module serves as a central export point for all the important functions, classes, and constants used in the Preact library. It provides a convenient way for developers to import and use these components in their own projects.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `version` variable?**\nThe `version` variable is used to trick libraries into thinking that Preact is actually React by setting it to '17.0.2'.\n\n2. **What is the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`?**\n`useEffect` is used to schedule a side effect after the component has rendered, while `useLayoutEffect` is used to schedule a side effect immediately after the DOM has been updated but before the browser has had a chance to paint.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `unstable_batchedUpdates` function?**\nThe `unstable_batchedUpdates` function is a deprecated way to control batched rendering inside the reconciler, but it is not necessary in Preact as rendering is already scheduled in batches within the rendering code.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/compat/src/index.md"}}],["38",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/compat/src/internal.d.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a TypeScript module that exports several interfaces used in the Preact project. These interfaces define the structure and behavior of components, virtual nodes, and suspense components in Preact.\n\nThe `Component` interface extends the `PreactComponent` interface and adds additional properties specific to Preact. It includes properties related to suspense, such as `_childDidSuspend`, `_suspended`, and `_onResolve`. These properties are used internally by Preact to handle suspending and resuming components. The interface also includes properties related to portals, such as `_temp` and `_container`.\n\nThe `FunctionComponent` interface extends the `PreactFunctionComponent` interface and adds additional properties specific to Preact. It includes a `shouldComponentUpdate` method that allows the component to control whether it should update based on the next props. It also includes properties related to patched lifecycles.\n\nThe `VNode` interface extends the `PreactVNode` interface and adds additional properties specific to Preact. It includes a `$$typeof` property that represents the type of the virtual node. It also includes a `preactCompatNormalized` property that indicates whether the virtual node has been normalized for compatibility with older versions of Preact.\n\nThe `SuspenseState` interface defines the state of a suspense component in Preact. It includes an optional `_suspended` property that represents the suspended virtual node.\n\nThe `SuspenseComponent` interface extends the `PreactComponent` interface and defines the behavior of a suspense component in Preact. It includes properties such as `_pendingSuspensionCount`, `_suspenders`, and `_detachOnNextRender` that are used internally by Preact to manage suspending and resuming components.\n\nThese interfaces are used throughout the Preact project to define the structure and behavior of components, virtual nodes, and suspense components. Developers using Preact can use these interfaces to create components that adhere to the Preact API and take advantage of features such as suspense. For example, a developer can create a component that extends the `Component` interface and implements the `_childDidSuspend` method to handle suspending and resuming of child components.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `Component` interface?**\nThe `Component` interface extends the `PreactComponent` interface and adds additional properties and methods related to Suspense and Portal functionality.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `FunctionComponent` interface?**\nThe `FunctionComponent` interface extends the `PreactFunctionComponent` interface and adds additional properties and methods related to shouldComponentUpdate and lifecycle patching.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `VNode` interface?**\nThe `VNode` interface extends the `PreactVNode` interface and adds additional properties related to compatibility with React and Preact.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/compat/src/internal.d.md"}}],["39",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/compat/src/memo.js)\n\nThe code provided is a function called `memo` that is used to memoize a component in the Preact project. Memoization is a technique used to optimize the rendering process by caching the result of a function call and returning the cached result when the same inputs are provided again.\n\nThe `memo` function takes two parameters: `c` and `comparer`. The `c` parameter is a functional component that will be memoized, and the `comparer` parameter is an optional custom equality function that determines whether the props of the component have changed.\n\nInside the `memo` function, there are two inner functions defined: `shouldUpdate` and `Memoed`. \n\nThe `shouldUpdate` function is responsible for determining whether the component should update based on the comparison of the current props and the next props. It first checks if the `ref` prop has changed. If it has, it calls the previous `ref` function with `null` or sets the `ref.current` value to `null`. Then, it checks if a custom `comparer` function is provided. If not, it uses the `shallowDiffers` function from the `./util` module to compare the props. If the props are different, it returns `true`, indicating that the component should update.\n\nThe `Memoed` function is the actual memoized component. It sets the `shouldComponentUpdate` property to the `shouldUpdate` function defined earlier. This ensures that the component only updates when the props have actually changed. It then creates and returns a new element using the `createElement` function from the `preact` module, passing in the original functional component `c` and the `props` parameter.\n\nFinally, the `Memoed` component has its `displayName` property set to `'Memo(' + (c.displayName || c.name) + ')'`, which is a string that represents the name of the memoized component. It also sets the `isReactComponent` property to `true` and the `_forwarded` property to `true`.\n\nOverall, this code allows developers to memoize functional components in the Preact project, improving performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when the props have not changed. It can be used by wrapping a functional component with the `memo` function, like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst MemoizedComponent = memo(MyComponent);\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. **What does the `memo` function do?**\nThe `memo` function is used to memoize a functional component, meaning it only updates when the props have actually changed.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `comparer` parameter in the `memo` function?**\nThe `comparer` parameter is an optional custom equality function that can be provided to determine if the props have changed.

It takes a `context` prop and sets it as the child context using the `getChildContext` method. The child components can then access this context using the `context` property. This component is useful when you want to pass data down the component tree without explicitly passing it through props. Here's an example of how `ContextProvider` can be used:\n\n```jsx\n<ContextProvider context={myContext}>\n  <ChildComponent />\n</ContextProvider>\n```\n\nThe `Portal` component is used to render a subtree of components at a different DOM node. It takes a `container` prop, which specifies the DOM node where the subtree should be rendered. The `Portal` component manages a temporary DOM node (`_temp`) that acts as a parent for the subtree. When the `Portal` component is unmounted, it removes the subtree from the original container. If the `container` prop changes, the `Portal` component unmounts itself and re-renders the subtree in the new container. This is useful when you want to render a component hierarchy outside of its parent component's DOM hierarchy. Here's an example of how `Portal` can be used:\n\n```jsx\nconst container = document.getElementById('portal-container');\n\n// Render the component hierarchy inside the portal container\ncreatePortal(\n  <App />,\n  container\n);\n```\n\nThe `createPortal` function is a utility function that creates an instance of the `Portal` component with the provided vnode and container, and returns it. It also sets the `containerInfo` property on the returned element to store a reference to the container DOM node. This function simplifies the process of creating and rendering a portal. Here's an example of how `createPortal` can be used:\n\n```jsx\nconst container = document.getElementById('portal-container');\n\n// Render the component hierarchy inside the portal container\nconst portal = createPortal(\n  <App />,\n  container\n);\n```\n\nIn summary, the `ContextProvider` component is used to provide a context to its child components, while the `Portal` component is used to render a subtree of components at a different DOM node. The `createPortal` function is a utility function that simplifies the process of creating and rendering a portal. These components and function are important for managing component contexts and rendering components outside of their parent's DOM hierarchy in the Preact project.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `ContextProvider` component?\n- The `ContextProvider` component is used to provide a context to its children components.\n\n2. Why is the `Portal` component using a fake DOM parent node?\n- The `Portal` component uses a fake DOM parent node to manage a subset of the `container`'s children and render its wrapping element into the fake parent node.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `createPortal` function?\n- The `createPortal` function is used to create a `Portal` component that continues rendering the vnode tree at a different DOM node.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/compat/src/portals.md"}}],["41",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/compat/src/render.js)\n\nThe code provided is a part of the Preact project and includes various utility functions and configurations related to rendering and handling DOM elements.\n\nThe code begins by importing necessary functions and classes from the 'preact' module. These include the `render` and `hydrate` functions, the `options` object, the `toChildArray` function, and the `Component` class.\n\nNext, the code defines a constant `REACT_ELEMENT_TYPE` which is used to determine the type of a React element. It checks if the `Symbol` object is available and if the `Symbol.for` method exists. If so, it assigns the value of `Symbol.for('react.element')` to `REACT_ELEMENT_TYPE`. Otherwise, it assigns the hexadecimal value `0xeac7` to `REACT_ELEMENT_TYPE`.\n\nThe code also defines regular expressions and functions related to handling DOM elements and events. These include regular expressions for matching CSS property names (`CAMEL_PROPS`), event names (`ON_ANI`), and converting camel case to hyphenated case (`CAMEL_REPLACE`). It also defines a function `onChangeInputType` which determines whether the `onchange` event should be converted to `oninput` for certain input types.\n\nThe code then extends the `Component` class prototype to include an `isReactComponent` property. This property is set to an empty object, indicating that the component is a React component.\n\nNext, the code defines a function `render` which is a proxy for the `preactRender` function. It takes a VNode tree, a parent DOM node, and an optional callback function. It renders the VNode tree into the parent DOM node using `preactRender`, and then calls the callback function if it is provided. It returns the root component reference or `null`.\n\nSimilarly, the code defines a function `hydrate` which is a proxy for the `preactHydrate` function. It takes a VNode tree, a parent DOM node, and an optional callback function. It hydrates the VNode tree into the parent DOM node using `preactHydrate`, and then calls the callback function if it is provided. It returns the root component reference or `null`.\n\nThe code also modifies the `options.event` function to add additional properties and methods to the event object. These include a `persist` method, and `isPropagationStopped` and `isDefaultPrevented` methods.\n\nThe code further includes functions and descriptors related to handling DOM elements and their properties. These functions handle normalization of props, conversion of event names, and setting default values for select elements.\n\nFinally, the code defines a private internal function `__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED` which is used for runtime dependency injection in React. It provides access to the current component's global context value.\n\nOverall, this code provides utility functions and configurations for rendering and handling DOM elements in the Preact project. It ensures compatibility with React and provides additional functionality for event handling and prop normalization.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It is set to a unique symbol or a specific number.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `onChangeInputType` function?\n- The `onChangeInputType` function is used to determine whether the `onchange` event should be converted to `oninput` for certain input types. It checks the type of the input and returns a boolean value.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `handleDomVNode` function?\n- The `handleDomVNode` function is used to handle and normalize props for DOM elements. It converts certain prop names to their lowercase equivalents and sets default values for certain props.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/compat/src/render.md"}}],["42",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/compat/src/suspense-list.d.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a TypeScript file that defines a class called `SuspenseList` and an interface called `SuspenseListProps`. This code is a part of the Preact project and is used to implement a feature called `SuspenseList`.\n\nThe `SuspenseList` component is used to manage the rendering order of multiple suspense components. Suspense components are used to suspend rendering and display fallback content while waiting for some asynchronous data to load. The `SuspenseList` component allows you to control the order in which these suspense components are rendered.\n\nThe `SuspenseList` class extends the `Component` class from the `preact` library, which is a lightweight alternative to React. It takes an optional `children` prop of type `ComponentChildren`, which represents the suspense components that are wrapped by the `SuspenseList` component. The `children` prop is used to specify the suspense components that should be managed by the `SuspenseList`.\n\nThe `revealOrder` prop is an optional prop of type `'forwards' | 'backwards' | 'together'`. It determines the order in which the suspense components are revealed. If set to `'forwards'`, the suspense components are revealed in the order they appear in the `children` prop. If set to `'backwards'`, the suspense components are revealed in the reverse order. If set to `'together'`, all suspense components are revealed together.\n\nHere's an example of how the `SuspenseList` component can be used:\n\n```jsx\nimport { h } from 'preact';\nimport { SuspenseList, Suspense } from 'preact/compat';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <SuspenseList revealOrder=\"forwards\">\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n        {/* Suspense component 1 */}\n      </Suspense>\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n        {/* Suspense component 2 */}\n      </Suspense>\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n        {/* Suspense component 3 */}\n      </Suspense>\n    </SuspenseList>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `SuspenseList` component is used to manage the rendering order of three suspense components. The `revealOrder` prop is set to `'forwards'`, so the suspense components will be revealed in the order they appear in the `SuspenseList` component.\n\nOverall, the `SuspenseList` component provides a way to control the rendering order of suspense components in the Preact project. It is a useful tool for managing the loading and rendering of asynchronous data in a predictable manner.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `SuspenseList` component?\n- The `SuspenseList` component is used to define the order in which suspended components are revealed.\n\n2. What are the available options for the `revealOrder` prop?\n- The `revealOrder` prop can have one of three values: 'forwards', 'backwards', or 'together'. \n\n3. What does the `render` method of the `SuspenseList` component return?\n- The `render` method of the `SuspenseList` component returns a `ComponentChild`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/compat/src/suspense-list.d.md"}}],["43",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/compat/src/suspense-list.js)\n\nThe code provided is a part of the Preact project and specifically focuses on the implementation of the `SuspenseList` component. \n\nThe `SuspenseList` component is used to manage the suspense state of its child components. It keeps track of the number of times a child component has been suspended and resolved, and also maintains a linked list of the child components. \n\nThe `SuspenseList` component is implemented as a function instead of a class to save memory. It has two properties: `_next` and `_map`. `_next` is used to keep track of the next node in the linked list, while `_map` is a `Map` object that stores the child components and their corresponding nodes in the linked list.\n\nThe `resolve` function is used to mark a child component's suspension as resolved. It increments the `RESOLVED_COUNT` of the node and checks if the child component has been completely resolved. If it has, the child component is removed from the `_map` object. If the `revealOrder` property is set and there are still suspended descendants, the function exits early. Otherwise, it walks through the currently suspended children in order and calls their stored callbacks. It stops if it encounters a child that has not been completely resolved yet.\n\nThe `SuspenseList` prototype inherits from the `Component` class provided by Preact. It overrides the `_suspended` method, which is called when a child component is suspended. It increments the `SUSPENDED_COUNT` of the node and returns a function that can be called to unsuspend the child component. If the `delegated` function is provided, it calls it with the `wrappedUnsuspend` function. Otherwise, it directly calls `wrappedUnsuspend`.\n\nThe `render` method is responsible for building the linked list of child components. It initializes `_next` and `_map`, and then iterates through the children in reverse order. For each child, it creates a new node in the linked list and adds it to the `_map` object. The method also checks if the `revealOrder` property is set to 'backwards' and reverses the order of the children accordingly. Finally, it returns the `props.children`.\n\nThe `componentDidUpdate` and `componentDidMount` methods are used to handle updates and mounting of the `SuspenseList` component. They iterate through all the children and call the `resolve` function to handle any nodes that may have been resolved between the render and the mounting of the component.\n\nOverall, the `SuspenseList` component is an important part of the Preact project as it provides a way to manage the suspense state of child components and handle their resolution in a specific order. It allows for more control over the rendering and loading of components, improving the user experience.\n## Questions: \n **Question 1:** What is the purpose of the `resolve` function?\n\n**Answer:** The `resolve` function is used to mark one of a child's earlier suspensions as resolved. It also processes any pending callbacks that may become callable due to this resolution.\n\n**Question 2:** How does the `SuspenseList` component handle the order in which children are revealed?\n\n**Answer:** The `SuspenseList` component checks the `revealOrder` prop to determine the order in which children should be revealed. If `revealOrder` is falsy or starts with 't', the component will reveal children together. If `revealOrder` starts with 'b', the component will reveal children in reverse order.\n\n**Question 3:** What is the purpose of the `componentDidUpdate` and `componentDidMount` methods in the `SuspenseList` component?\n\n**Answer:** The `componentDidUpdate` and `componentDidMount` methods in the `SuspenseList` component iterate through all children after mounting or updating. This allows the component to balance the suspended and resolved counters for each child and handle any nodes that may have been resolved between render and mounting.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/compat/src/suspense-list.md"}}],["44",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/compat/src/suspense.d.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a part of the Preact project and it focuses on the implementation of the Suspense and lazy features.\n\nThe `lazy` function is a utility function that allows for lazy loading of components. It takes a function called `loader` as a parameter, which returns a Promise that resolves to the component to be loaded. The component can be either a default export or a named export. The `lazy` function returns the loaded component.\n\nHere is an example of how the `lazy` function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { lazy } from 'preact';\n\nconst MyLazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./MyLazyComponent'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Lazy Loading Example</h1>\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n        <MyLazyComponent />\n      </Suspense>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `MyLazyComponent` is lazily loaded using the `lazy` function. While the component is being loaded, the `Suspense` component is rendered with a fallback UI, in this case, a simple \"Loading...\" message. Once the component is loaded, it is rendered in place of the fallback UI.\n\nThe `Suspense` component is a class component that extends the `Component` class from the Preact library. It takes two props: `children` and `fallback`. The `children` prop represents the content that will be rendered when the component is not in a suspended state. The `fallback` prop represents the content that will be rendered when the component is in a suspended state.\n\nHere is an example of how the `Suspense` component can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Suspense } from 'preact';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Suspense Example</h1>\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n        <SomeComponent />\n      </Suspense>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `SomeComponent` is wrapped in the `Suspense` component. When the `SomeComponent` is being loaded or is in a suspended state, the fallback UI, in this case, a \"Loading...\" message, will be rendered. Once the `SomeComponent` is ready, it will be rendered in place of the fallback UI.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to lazily load components and handle the rendering of fallback UI while the components are being loaded. This can be useful for optimizing the initial load time of an application by deferring the loading of less critical components.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `lazy` function and how is it used?\n- The `lazy` function is used for lazy loading components in Preact. It takes a function that returns a Promise and returns the default export of the module or the module itself.\n\n2. What are the props that can be passed to the `Suspense` component?\n- The `Suspense` component accepts two props: `children` which represents the content to be rendered and `fallback` which represents the content to be shown while the main content is being loaded.\n\n3. How does the `Suspense` component render its content?\n- The `Suspense` component renders its content by implementing the `render` method from the `Component` class. The `render` method returns a `ComponentChild`, which represents the rendered content.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/compat/src/suspense.d.md"}}],["45",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/compat/src/suspense.js)\n\nThe code provided is a part of the Preact project and includes several functions and a class that are used for handling suspensions and lazy loading of components.\n\nThe `options._catchError` function is used to handle errors that occur during rendering. If an error is a promise, it checks if the component is a Suspense component and if so, it calls the `_childDidSuspend` method on the component. This method handles the suspension of the component and its children.\n\nThe `options.unmount` function is used to handle the unmounting of components. If a component has a `_onResolve` method, it calls that method to resolve the suspension. If the component is still hydrating, it sets the `vnode.type` to `null` to remove the component from the DOM.\n\nThe `detachedClone` function is used to clone a vnode and detach it from its parent. It recursively clones the vnode and its children, removing any references to the original component and updating the parent DOM reference.\n\nThe `removeOriginal` function is used to remove the original vnode from the DOM and restore the suspended vnode. It recursively removes the original vnode and its children, and if the component is still hydrating, it restores the vnode's DOM reference and parent DOM reference.\n\nThe `Suspense` class is a custom implementation of a Suspense component. It extends the `Component` class from Preact and includes methods for handling suspensions. The `_childDidSuspend` method is called when a child component suspends. It adds the suspending component to the `_suspenders` array and resolves the suspension when all suspensions have been resolved. The `componentWillUnmount` method clears the `_suspenders` array when the component is unmounted. The `render` method renders the children and a fallback component if the component is suspended.\n\nThe `suspended` function is used to notify a parent component that one of its children has suspended. It calls the parent component's `_suspended` method and returns a callback that can be used to unsuspend the component.\n\nThe `lazy` function is used for lazy loading components. It takes a loader function as a parameter and returns a Lazy component. The Lazy component loads the component asynchronously and renders it when it is available. If an error occurs during loading, it throws the error. If the component is not yet available, it throws a promise that can be caught and handled by the Suspense component.\n\nOverall, this code provides the necessary functionality for handling suspensions and lazy loading of components in the Preact project. It allows components to suspend rendering and display fallback content until the suspended components are ready. It also enables lazy loading of components to improve performance by loading components only when they are needed.\n## Questions: \n **Question 1:** What is the purpose of the `_catchError` function and how does it handle Suspense components?\n\n**Answer:** The `_catchError` function is used to handle errors thrown by promises. If the error is a promise, the function checks if there is a Suspense component in the component hierarchy. If a Suspense component is found, it calls the `_childDidSuspend` method of the Suspense component and passes the error and the new VNode.\n\n**Question 2:** What is the purpose of the `detachedClone` function and how does it work?\n\n**Answer:** The `detachedClone` function is used to create a detached clone of a VNode. It creates a shallow copy of the VNode and sets the `_component` property to null. It also recursively clones the children of the VNode. This function is used when a Suspense component suspends and needs to detach its children from the DOM.\n\n**Question 3:** How does the `Suspense` component handle suspensions and resumptions?\n\n**Answer:** The `Suspense` component keeps track of the number of pending suspensions using the `_pendingSuspensionCount` property. When a child component suspends, it adds the suspending component to the `_suspenders` array and increments the `_pendingSuspensionCount`. When a suspension is resolved, the `_onResolve` callback is called, which decreases the `_pendingSuspensionCount`. If there are no more pending suspensions, the `onSuspensionComplete` function is called, which updates the state of the `Suspense` component and forces a re-render.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/compat/src/suspense.md"}}],["46",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/compat/src/util.js)\n\nThe code provided in this file contains several utility functions that can be used in the larger Preact project.\n\nThe first function, `assign`, is used to copy properties from one object to another. It takes two parameters: `obj`, which is the object to copy properties to, and `props`, which is the object to copy properties from. The function iterates over the properties of `props` and assigns them to `obj`. It then returns the resulting object, which has the properties from both `obj` and `props`. Here is an example usage of the `assign` function:\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = { a: 1 };\nconst props = { b: 2 };\nconst result = assign(obj, props);\nconsole.log(result); // { a: 1, b: 2 }\n```\n\nThe second function, `shallowDiffers`, is used to check if two objects have a different shape. It takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are the objects to compare. The function iterates over the properties of `a` and checks if each property is present in `b`. If a property is found in `a` that is not present in `b`, or if the values of corresponding properties in `a` and `b` are different, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. This function can be used, for example, to determine if a component needs to be re-rendered based on changes in its props. Here is an example usage of the `shallowDiffers` function:\n\n```javascript\nconst a = { x: 1, y: 2 };\nconst b = { x: 1, y: 3 };\nconst differs = shallowDiffers(a, b);\nconsole.log(differs); // true\n```\n\nThe third function, `removeNode`, is a simple utility function that removes a given node from its parent node. It takes one parameter, `node`, which is the node to remove. The function first gets the parent node of `node` and then removes `node` from its parent. This function can be used, for example, to remove a DOM element from the document. Here is an example usage of the `removeNode` function:\n\n```javascript\nconst node = document.getElementById('myElement');\nremoveNode(node);\n```\n\nThe fourth function, `is`, is used to check if two values are the same value. It takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are the values to compare. The function first checks if `x` and `y` are strictly equal (`===`). If they are, it also checks if they are not equal to zero (`x !== 0`) or if their division by zero is equal (`1 / x === 1 / y`). If any of these conditions is true, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it checks if `x` and `y` are both NaN (not a number) and returns `true` if they are. Otherwise, it returns `false`. This function can be used, for example, to compare values in a deep equality check. Here is an example usage of the `is` function:\n\n```javascript\nconst x = 5;\nconst y = 5;\nconst result = is(x, y);\nconsole.log(result); // true\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What does the `assign` function do and what are its input and output types?\n- The `assign` function copies properties from the `props` object to the `obj` object and returns the combined object. The input types are `O` and `P`, and the output type is `O & P`.\n\n2. What does the `shallowDiffers` function do and what are its input and output types?\n- The `shallowDiffers` function checks if two objects have a different shape by comparing their properties. The input types are `object` for both `a` and `b`, and the output type is `boolean`.\n\n3. What does the `is` function do and what are its input and output types?\n- The `is` function checks if two values are the same value, including handling special cases like NaN and -0. The input types are `*` for both `x` and `y`, and the output type is `boolean`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/compat/src/util.md"}}],["47",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/config/codemod-const.js)\n\nThe purpose of this code is to find constants in a JavaScript file and inline them globally. It is specifically designed for the Preact project, which only uses global constants. \n\nThe code takes in a JavaScript file and an API object as parameters. It then uses the `jscodeshift` library provided by the API to parse the source code of the file. \n\nThe code initializes an empty object called `constants` to store the found constants and a variable `found` to keep track of the number of constants found. \n\nThe code then uses the `find` method to search for `VariableDeclaration` nodes in the parsed code. It filters the found declarations based on certain conditions. For each declaration, it iterates over the declarations within it and checks if the name of the declaration is in all caps and does not have a regular expression as its initializer. If these conditions are met, it adds the constant to the `constants` object, increments the `found` variable, and removes the declaration from the code. If the declaration is the last one in the `VariableDeclaration`, the whole statement is removed. \n\nNext, the code uses the `find` method again to search for `Identifier` nodes in the code. It filters the found identifiers based on whether they are present in the `constants` object. For each identifier, it replaces it with the corresponding constant from the `constants` object and increments the `found` variable. \n\nFinally, the code checks if any constants were found. If so, it returns the modified code with the constants inlined globally. Otherwise, it returns `null`. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger Preact project to optimize the usage of constants. By inlining the constants globally, it reduces the need for constant lookups and improves performance. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport inlineConstants from 'path/to/inlineConstants';\n\nconst file = `\n\tconst PI = 3.14159;\n\tconst MAX_VALUE = 100;\n\tconst MIN_VALUE = 0;\n\n\tfunction calculateArea(radius) {\n\t\treturn PI * radius * radius;\n\t}\n`;\n\nconst api = {\n\tjscodeshift: require('jscodeshift')\n};\n\nconst modifiedCode = inlineConstants(file, api);\nconsole.log(modifiedCode);\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```javascript\n\tfunction calculateArea(radius) {\n\t\treturn 3.14159 * radius * radius;\n\t}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of inlining constants globally in Preact?\n- The purpose of inlining constants globally in Preact is to find constants identified by ALL_CAPS_DECLARATIONS and replace them with their corresponding values throughout the codebase.\n\n2. How does the code determine which constants to inline?\n- The code determines which constants to inline by finding variable declarations and filtering them based on certain conditions, such as the name matching a specific pattern and the initialization not being a regular expression.\n\n3. What happens if a constant is found and inlined?\n- If a constant is found and inlined, the declaration is removed from the code, and any subsequent references to the constant are replaced with its value.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/config/codemod-const.md"}}],["48",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/config/codemod-let-name.js)\n\nThe purpose of this code is to restore variable names that have been transformed by Babel's let block scoping. Babel is a popular JavaScript compiler that allows developers to write code using the latest JavaScript features and then compiles it into code that can run in older browsers. One of the transformations that Babel performs is converting block-scoped variables (declared using `let` or `const`) into variables with unique names to avoid naming conflicts.\n\nIn this code, the function takes in two parameters: `file` and `api`. `file` represents the source code file that needs to be transformed, and `api` is an object that provides access to various utilities and methods for manipulating the code.\n\nThe function first initializes a variable `j` with the value of `api.jscodeshift`, which is a library that provides a collection of utilities for manipulating JavaScript code using an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation.\n\nNext, the code uses the `j` object to parse the source code file into an AST representation. The AST allows the code to be analyzed and transformed programmatically.\n\nThe code then performs two transformations on the AST. First, it finds all variable declarators (variable declarations) in the code and filters them based on a regular expression pattern. The pattern `/^_i/.test(d.value.id.name)` matches variable names that start with \"_i\". These variable names are likely to be the ones transformed by Babel's let block scoping. The code then renames these variables to \"i\".\n\nThe second transformation finds all variable declarators with the name \"_key\" and renames them to \"key\".\n\nFinally, the code returns the modified source code by calling `code.toSource({ quote: 'single' })`. The `quote` option specifies that the modified code should use single quotes for string literals.\n\nThis code can be used as a part of a larger project that involves transforming JavaScript code using Babel. It specifically addresses the issue of restoring variable names that have been transformed by Babel's let block scoping. By using this code, developers can ensure that the variable names in their code are consistent and readable, even after Babel's transformations.\n## Questions: \n 1. What does this code do?\n- This code is a function that restores variable names that have been transformed by Babel's let block scoping.\n\n2. Why is there a comment mentioning that the code is unsafe?\n- The comment mentions that the code is unsafe because it is making a trade-off between safety and file size. Without the unsafe code, the file size would increase by 20b when gzipped.\n\n3. What does the `code.toSource({ quote: 'single' })` line do?\n- This line converts the modified code back into source code, using single quotes for string literals.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/config/codemod-let-name.md"}}],["49",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/config/codemod-strip-tdz.js)\n\nThe purpose of this code is to remove variable initializations to `void 0` in a JavaScript file. This is done because Babel adds these initializations for Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) strictness, but they are unnecessary and can be removed.\n\nThe code takes in a JavaScript file and an API object as parameters. It uses the `jscodeshift` property from the API object to perform code transformations. The code then initializes a `found` variable to keep track of the number of variable initializations that are removed.\n\nThe code uses the `jscodeshift` function to find all instances of `VariableDeclaration` in the JavaScript file. For each `VariableDeclaration` found, the `handleDeclaration` function is called.\n\nThe `handleDeclaration` function takes in a `decl` parameter, which represents a `VariableDeclaration`. It checks if the parent node type of the `VariableDeclaration` is in the `BLOCKED` array. If it is, the `remove` variable is set to `false`, indicating that the initialization should not be removed. If it is not in the `BLOCKED` array, the `remove` variable is set to `true`.\n\nThe `decl.value.declarations` property is then filtered to only include declarations that are considered \"pointless\" according to the `isPointless` function. The `isPointless` function checks if the initialization is either `void 0` or `undefined`. If it is, the function returns `true`, indicating that the initialization should be removed.\n\nIf the `remove` variable is `false`, a message is logged to the console indicating that the removal of the undefined initialization is being skipped. Otherwise, the `removeNodeInitialization` function is called to remove the initialization.\n\nThe `removeNodeInitialization` function sets the `init` property of the node to `null`, effectively removing the initialization.\n\nFinally, the code checks if any initializations were removed. If there were, it returns the modified code using the `toSource` method. Otherwise, it returns `null`.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger Preact project to remove unnecessary variable initializations and optimize the code. For example, if there is a variable declaration like `var x = void 0;`, this code will remove the initialization to `void 0`, resulting in just `var x;`. This can help reduce the size of the code and improve performance.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `BLOCKED` array and how is it used in the code?\nThe `BLOCKED` array contains a list of parent node types that should not have their var initialization removed. It is used to check if the current parent node type is in the `BLOCKED` array and if so, the var initialization is not removed.\n\n2. What does the `removeNodeInitialization` function do?\nThe `removeNodeInitialization` function sets the `init` property of a given node to `null`, effectively removing the initialization of the variable.\n\n3. What conditions are checked in the `isPointless` function to determine if a node's initialization is pointless?\nThe `isPointless` function checks if the `init` property of a node is either a UnaryExpression with operator 'void' and argument value 0, or an Identifier with name 'undefined'. If either of these conditions is true, the initialization is considered pointless.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/config/codemod-strip-tdz.md"}}],["50",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/config/compat-entries.js)\n\nThe purpose of this code is to check if all the files in the `compat` directory are included in the `files` entry of the `package.json` file. If any files are missing, an error message is logged and the process exits with a status code of 1.\n\nThe code starts by importing the necessary modules: `path`, `fs`, and `kolorist`. `path` is used to manipulate file paths, `fs` is used to interact with the file system, and `kolorist` is used for colorizing console output.\n\nNext, it creates a `Set` called `pkgFiles` that contains the list of files specified in the `files` entry of the `package.json` file. It then defines the `compatDir` variable, which is the path to the `compat` directory relative to the current file. After that, it reads the contents of the `compat` directory using `fs.readdirSync()` and stores the result in the `files` variable.\n\nThe code then initializes a variable called `missing` to keep track of the number of missing files. It iterates over each file in the `files` array and checks if it has a `.js` or `.mjs` extension and if it is not included in the `pkgFiles` set. If a file is missing, the `missing` counter is incremented, and an error message is logged to the console using `console.error()`. The error message includes the name of the missing file and highlights it in red.\n\nFinally, if there are any missing files (i.e., `missing > 0`), the process exits with a status code of 1 using `process.exit(1)`. This indicates that there was an error in the file inclusion check.\n\nThis code is likely used as a build step or a pre-publish check in the larger Preact project. It ensures that all the necessary files in the `compat` directory are included in the `files` entry of the `package.json` file. By doing so, it helps maintain the integrity of the project's distribution package and ensures that all required files are included when the project is published or distributed.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `pkgFiles` variable and how is it being used?\n- The `pkgFiles` variable is a Set that contains the files listed in the `files` entry of the `package.json` file.

This module is necessary for reading and writing files.\n\nNext, there is an array called 'subRepositories' that contains the names of several sub-repositories within the Preact project.

It takes the name of the file as input. If the name includes a hyphen, it uses the 'snakeCaseToCamelCase' function to convert the name to camelCase. It then uses the 'fs' module to read the contents of the original file and write those contents to a new file with the modified name. This function is called for each sub-repository name in the 'subRepositories' array.\n\nIn summary, this script is used to copy files with a specific file extension from one location to another. It is specifically used in the Preact project to ensure compatibility with Node 13.

It states that the file controls protected/private property mangling to ensure consistent property names in minified builds. It also explains that most properties are only used on one type of objects, so they can have the same name without colliding, which helps reduce the size of the minified builds.\n\nThe \"minify\" section contains the configuration for property mangling.

It sets the `loggedTypeFailures` object to an empty object, effectively clearing any previously logged warnings.\n\nThe `checkPropTypes` function is used to assert that the values passed to a component match the specified type specifications. It takes in several parameters:\n- `typeSpecs`: A map of prop names to their corresponding ReactPropTypes.\n- `values`: The runtime values that need to be type-checked.\n- `location`: A string indicating the location of the prop being checked (e.g., \"prop\", \"context\", \"child context\").\n- `componentName`: The name of the component being checked, used for error messages.\n- `getStack`: An optional function that returns the component stack.\n\nThe function iterates over each key in the `typeSpecs` object and attempts to execute the corresponding prop type function with the provided values. If an error occurs during the type checking, the error is caught and stored in the `error` variable.

It checks the type of the vnode and returns the appropriate name. If the vnode represents a Fragment, it returns the string \"Fragment\". If the vnode represents a functional component, it returns the `displayName` property of the component or the `name` property if `displayName` is not available. If the vnode represents a DOM node, it returns the string representing the type of the node.

If the owner component has a `__source` property, it appends the file name and line number to the stack string. If the `__source` property is not available and the `hasBabelPlugin` variable is false, it sets `hasBabelPlugin` to true and logs a warning message to the console.\n\nThe `setupComponentStack` function sets up the code to capture the component trace during rendering. It overrides certain functions in the `options` object provided by the Preact library. The overridden functions are `_diff`, `diffed`, `_root`, `vnode`, and `_render`. These functions are called at different stages of rendering and allow us to track the currently rendered vnode and its owner component.

These constants represent different types of nodes in the Document Object Model (DOM).\n\nThe DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree-like structure, where each node in the tree represents a part of the document (e.g., an element, a text node, etc.). The DOM provides methods and properties to manipulate and interact with these nodes.\n\nIn the context of the Preact project, these constants are likely used to identify and differentiate between different types of nodes when working with the DOM. They can be used in various scenarios, such as:\n\n1. Node traversal: When traversing the DOM tree, these constants can be used to check the type of a node and perform specific actions based on its type. For example, if a function is iterating over child nodes of an element, it can use these constants to skip text nodes and only process element nodes.\n\n```javascript\nfunction processChildNodes(element) {\n  for (let i = 0; i < element.childNodes.length; i++) {\n    const node = element.childNodes[i];\n    if (node.nodeType === ELEMENT_NODE) {\n      // Process element node\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Node creation: When creating new nodes in the DOM, these constants can be used to specify the type of the node being created. For example, when creating a new element node, the `ELEMENT_NODE` constant can be used as an argument to the `document.createElement` method.\n\n```javascript\nconst newElement = document.createElement(ELEMENT_NODE);\n```\n\nBy providing these constants, the Preact project ensures a consistent and standardized way of working with different types of nodes in the DOM. This can help improve code readability, maintainability, and reduce the likelihood of errors when interacting with the DOM.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It is a lightweight alternative to React, providing similar functionality but with a smaller footprint. Preact allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage their state efficiently.\n\nIn Preact, prop types are used to define the expected types and shapes of the props that are passed to a component. This helps ensure that the component is used correctly and can provide meaningful error messages when props are used incorrectly.\n\nThe `resetPropWarnings` function is likely used internally by Preact to manage the logging of prop type warnings. When this function is called, it clears the history of prop type warnings that have been logged. This can be useful in scenarios where the developer wants to reset the warnings and start fresh, such as when re-rendering a component or when switching between different parts of an application.\n\nHere is an example of how the `resetPropWarnings` function might be used in a Preact component:\n\n```javascript\nimport { resetPropWarnings } from 'preact';\n\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\n  // ... component logic ...\n\n  // Reset prop warnings before rendering\n  resetPropWarnings();\n\n  return (\n    // ... component JSX ...\n  );\n}\n```\n\nBy calling `resetPropWarnings` before rendering the component, any previously logged prop type warnings will be cleared, ensuring that only new warnings are logged. This can be helpful in keeping the console output clean and focused on the current state of the component.\n\nOverall, the `resetPropWarnings` function plays a role in managing prop type warnings in the Preact library, allowing developers to reset the warning history as needed.\n## Questions: \n **1.

It takes two parameters: `obj` and `props`. The `obj` parameter represents the object to which the properties will be copied, while the `props` parameter represents the object from which the properties will be copied.\n\nThe function uses a `for...in` loop to iterate over each property in the `props` object. For each property, it assigns the value of that property to the corresponding property in the `obj` object. This is done using the assignment operator (`=`).\n\nAfter all the properties have been copied, the function returns the modified `obj` object. The return type of the function is specified using the `@returns` JSDoc tag, which indicates that the return value is of type `O & P`. This means that the returned object will have all the properties of both `obj` and `props`.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `assign` function:\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = { a: 1 };\nconst props = { b: 2, c: 3 };\n\nconst result = assign(obj, props);\nconsole.log(result); // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }\n```\n\nThe `isNaN` function is a simple utility function that checks if a value is NaN (Not a Number). It takes a single parameter `value` and returns `true` if the value is NaN, and `false` otherwise.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `isNaN` function:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(isNaN(5)); // false\nconsole.log(isNaN(NaN)); // true\n```\n\nThese functions can be used in the larger Preact project to perform common tasks such as copying properties between objects and checking for NaN values. The `assign` function can be particularly useful when working with component props, allowing developers to easily merge and update props from different sources. The `isNaN` function can be used for input validation or to handle specific cases where NaN values need to be identified.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What does the `assign` function do?**\nThe `assign` function takes two objects, `obj` and `props`, and copies the properties from `props` to `obj`. It returns an object that has the combined properties of `obj` and `props`.\n\n2. **What are the types of `obj` and `props` in the `assign` function?**\nThe types of `obj` and `props` are represented by the generic types `O` and `P` respectively. These types are not specified in the code snippet and would need to be inferred from the context in which the `assign` function is used.\n\n3. **What does the `isNaN` function do?**\nThe `isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN (Not a Number) by comparing it to itself. It returns `true` if the value is NaN and `false` otherwise.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/debug/src/util.md"}}],["60",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/demo/contenteditable.jsx)\n\nThe code provided is a functional component called `Contenteditable` that is exported as the default export. This component is responsible for rendering an editable div element with some additional functionality.\n\nThe component imports the `useState` hook from the `preact/hooks` module. This hook allows the component to manage state within a functional component. The `useState` hook is used to define a state variable called `value` and a function called `setValue` to update the state. The initial value of the `value` state variable is set to the string \"Hey there<br />I'm editable!\".\n\nThe `Contenteditable` component returns a JSX expression that renders a div element with two child elements. The first child element is a div containing a button. When this button is clicked, it triggers an onClick event handler that calls the `setValue` function with an empty string, effectively clearing the content of the editable div.\n\nThe second child element is the editable div itself. It has several properties and event handlers attached to it. The `style` property is an object that defines the CSS styles for the div, including a gray border, padding, margin, and a white background. The `contentEditable` property is set to true, which allows the div to be edited by the user.\n\nThe `onInput` event handler is triggered whenever the content of the div is changed. It updates the `value` state variable with the new content of the div by accessing the `innerHTML` property of the event target. This ensures that the `value` state variable always reflects the current content of the div.\n\nThe `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` property is used to set the initial HTML content of the div. It takes an object with a single property `__html` that contains the value of the `value` state variable. This allows the initial content of the div to be set based on the value of the `value` state variable.\n\nIn summary, the `Contenteditable` component provides a simple way to render an editable div element with the ability to clear its content. It uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the div's content and provides event handlers to update the state when the content is changed. This component can be used in a larger project whenever an editable div element is needed.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It also creates a `Provider` and `Consumer` object using the `createContext` function.\n\nNext, there are three classes defined: `ThemeProvider`, `Child`, and `ContextDemo`.\n\nThe `ThemeProvider` class extends the `Component` class from Preact. It has a `state` object that contains a `value` property, which is initialized with the value passed in through the `props`. The `ThemeProvider` class also has an `onClick` method that toggles the `value` property between the current value and the `next` value passed in through the `props`. The `render` method of `ThemeProvider` returns a `div` element with a button that triggers the `onClick` method and a `Provider` component that wraps the `children` passed in through the `props`.\n\nThe `Child` class also extends the `Component` class. It overrides the `shouldComponentUpdate` method to always return `false`, preventing any updates to the component. The `render` method of `Child` returns a `p` element with the text \"(blocked update)\" and the `children` passed in through the props.\n\nThe `ContextDemo` class is the default export of the file. It also extends the `Component` class. In its `render` method, it renders a `ThemeProvider` component with a `value` of \"blue\" and `next` of \"red\". Inside the `ThemeProvider`, it renders a `Child` component. Inside the `Child`, it renders a `Consumer` component that receives the `data` value from the `Provider` in the `ThemeProvider`. It then renders a `div` element with a `p` element displaying the `data` value. Inside this `div`, it renders another `ThemeProvider` component with a different `value` and `next` value. Inside this nested `ThemeProvider`, it renders another `Consumer` component that displays the `data` value.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to use the `createContext` API in Preact to manage and share state between components. The `ThemeProvider` component acts as a provider of the `value` state, which can be accessed by the `Consumer` components. The `Child` component demonstrates how to prevent unnecessary updates by overriding the `shouldComponentUpdate` method. The `ContextDemo` component shows an example of how to use the `ThemeProvider` and `Consumer` components together to share and display the state value.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger Preact project to manage and share state between components, allowing for a more efficient and organized way of handling data flow and updates within the application.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `ThemeProvider` component?**\nThe `ThemeProvider` component is responsible for managing the theme value and providing it to its child components through the `Provider` component from the `createContext()` function.\n\n2. **Why does the `Child` component have a `shouldComponentUpdate` method that always returns `false`?**\nThe `shouldComponentUpdate` method in the `Child` component is used to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of the component and its children, ensuring that it only updates when necessary.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `Consumer` component and how is it used in the code?**\nThe `Consumer` component is used to access the value provided by the nearest `Provider` component in the component tree.

Memoization is a technique used to optimize the rendering process by caching the result of a function call and returning the cached result when the same inputs are provided again. In this code, the `Foo` component is wrapped with `memo()` to create the `Memoed` component. This means that the `Memoed` component will only re-render if its props change. This can be useful when dealing with expensive calculations or when optimizing performance in certain scenarios.\n\nThe `lazy()` function is used to enable lazy loading of components. Lazy loading is a technique used to defer the loading of a component until it is actually needed. This can help improve the initial loading time of an application by only loading the necessary components when they are required. In this code, the `LazyComp` component is wrapped with `lazy()` to create the `Lazy` component. The `lazy()` function takes a function as an argument that returns a promise which resolves to the module containing the lazily loaded component. In this case, the promise is immediately resolved with an object that has a `default` property pointing to the `LazyComp` component. The `Lazy` component is then rendered inside a `Suspense` component, which allows us to specify a fallback UI to be displayed while the lazily loaded component is being loaded.\n\nThe `DevtoolsDemo` class component is the main component that is exported from this file. It renders a simple UI that showcases the usage of the `memo()` and `lazy()` functions. It renders the `Memoed` component, which is a memoized version of the `Foo` component, and the `Lazy` component, which is a lazily loaded version of the `LazyComp` component. The `Suspense` component is used to handle the loading state of the `Lazy` component and display a fallback UI while it is being loaded.\n\nOverall, this code demonstrates how to use the `memo()` and `lazy()` functions to optimize rendering and enable lazy loading of components in a Preact project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This state property is used to keep track of a number that will be displayed in the rendered output.\n\nThe `componentDidMount` lifecycle method is used to schedule a function called `updateChildren` to be called every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) using the `setInterval` function. This means that the `updateChildren` function will be called repeatedly, updating the state of the component and triggering a re-render.\n\nThe `updateChildren` function is responsible for updating the state of the component by incrementing the `number` property by 1. It uses the `setState` method provided by the `Component` class to update the state based on the previous state.\n\nThe `render` method is responsible for rendering the output of the component. It takes two arguments, `props` and `state`, which represent the current props and state of the component, respectively. \n\nIn the render method, a div element is rendered with two child elements. The first child element is a div that displays the value of `state.number`. The second child element is a fragment (`<>...</>`) that contains three div elements. The second div element within the fragment also displays the value of `state.number`. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to demonstrate the usage of fragments in Preact. Fragments allow multiple elements to be grouped together without adding an extra wrapping element to the DOM. In this case, the fragment is used to group three div elements together. The value of `state.number` is displayed in two places, once outside the fragment and once inside the fragment.\n\nThis code can be used as a reference for developers who want to understand how to use fragments in Preact and how to update the state of a component at regular intervals. It can also be used as a starting point for building more complex components that require the use of fragments and state updates.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It renders a navigation bar (`nav` element) and a `Router` component from the Preact library. The `Router` component is responsible for rendering the appropriate component based on the current URL. Each `Link` component in the navigation bar corresponds to a specific URL path and will render the associated component when clicked.\n\nThe `Router` component is configured with multiple `path` props that define the URL paths and the corresponding components to render. For example, the `Home` component is rendered when the URL path is `/`, the `Reorder` component is rendered when the URL path is `/reorder`, and so on.\n\nSome components, such as `Spiral` and `Pythagoras`, are conditionally rendered based on whether the application is being used for benchmarking.

If `useKeys` is true, each list item will have a unique key based on its `name` property.\n\nThe `useCounts` prop is a boolean that determines whether or not to display the number of renders for each list item.\n\nThe `update` prop is a function that allows for updating the state of the `List` component.\n\nInside the `List` component, there are three functions: `toggleKeys`, `toggleCounts`, and `swap`. \n\nThe `toggleKeys` function toggles the value of `useKeys` by calling the `update` function with the updated state.\n\nThe `toggleCounts` function toggles the value of `useCounts` by calling the `update` function with the updated state.\n\nThe `swap` function swaps the positions of the second and eighth items in the `items` array by creating a new array `u` and updating the state with the new array.\n\nThe `List` component returns a JSX template using the `html` function from the `htm` library. The template consists of a `div` element containing several buttons, checkboxes, and a `ul` element.\n\nThe `button` elements have event listeners that call the `update` and `swap` functions when clicked.\n\nThe `checkbox` elements have event listeners that call the `toggleKeys` and `toggleCounts` functions when clicked.\n\nThe `ul` element contains a `map` function that iterates over the `items` array and renders a `li` element for each item. The `class` attribute of each `li` element is set based on the index of the item in the array. If `useKeys` is true, the `key` attribute of each `li` element is set to the `name` property of the item.\n\nFinally, the `root` variable is created using the `createRoot` function, which takes in the `document.body` as the parent element. The `data` object is initialized with default values for `items`, `renders`, `useKeys`, and `useCounts`. The `update` function is called to render the `List` component with the initial state.\n\nIn summary, this code defines a `List` component that renders a list of items with customizable options. It allows for toggling the use of keys and counts, swapping items, and re-rendering the list. This component can be used in the larger Preact project to display and manipulate lists of items.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `createRoot` function?\n- The `createRoot` function is used to create a root element for rendering the Preact component.\n\n2. What does the `update` function do?\n- The `update` function is responsible for updating the `data` object with the provided partial data and then re-rendering the `List` component with the updated data.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useKeys` and `useCounts` variables?\n- The `useKeys` variable is used to determine whether to use keys for the list items in the `List` component, and the `useCounts` variable is used to determine whether to display the number of renders for each list item.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/demo/list.md"}}],["67",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/demo/logger.jsx)\n\nThe code provided is a logger function that logs method calls and their arguments to the console. It also provides an option to log the method calls and their arguments to a table for statistical analysis.\n\nThe logger function takes two parameters: `logStats` and `logConsole`. If both parameters are false, the function returns immediately and does nothing. If either parameter is true, the logger function proceeds with its execution.\n\nThe function initializes a `consoleBuffer` object, which is an instance of the `ConsoleBuffer` class. The `ConsoleBuffer` class is responsible for buffering console method calls and replaying them at the end of the current stack to improve performance.\n\nThe logger function defines several helper functions. The `serialize` function is used to convert objects into string representations. It checks the type of the object and returns a corresponding string representation. For example, if the object is an instance of `Text`, it returns \"#text\". If the object is an instance of `Element`, it returns the local name of the element enclosed in angle brackets.\n\nThe `count` function is used to keep track of the number of times a method is called. It takes a `key` parameter, which is a string representation of the method call, and increments the count for that key in the `calls` object. If `logConsole` is true, it also logs the key to the console buffer.\n\nThe `logCall` function is used to override the specified method on an object and log its calls. It takes three parameters: `obj`, `method`, and `name`. It stores the original method in the `old` variable, and then replaces the method with a new function that logs the method call and its arguments using the `count` function. Finally, it calls the original method with the provided arguments.\n\nThe logger function uses the `logCall` function to override several methods on the `document` object and the `Element.prototype` object. These methods include `createElement`, `createElementNS`, `remove`, `appendChild`, `removeChild`, `insertBefore`, `replaceChild`, `setAttribute`, `setAttributeNS`, `removeAttribute`, and `removeAttributeNS`. By overriding these methods, the logger function is able to log their calls and arguments.\n\nThe logger function also overrides the `data` property of the `Text.prototype` object to log its get and set operations. It uses the `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` method to get the property descriptor of the `data` property on either the `CharacterData.prototype` object or the `Node.prototype` object, and then defines a new getter and setter for the `data` property on the `Text.prototype` object. The getter and setter log the get and set operations using the `count` function.\n\nThe logger function defines a `setup` function that is called if `logStats` is true. The `setup` function creates a table element and appends it to the document. It also adds a click event listener to a button in the table header that clears the `calls` object.\n\nThe logger function defines a `createRow` function that is used to create a row in the table for a specific method call. It takes an `id` parameter, which is a string representation of the method call, and creates a new row element with two cells: one for the method call key and one for the method call count. It appends the row to the table body and returns the row element.\n\nThe logger function defines an `insertInto` function that is used to insert the table into a parent element. It takes a `parent` parameter and appends the table to the parent element.\n\nThe logger function defines a `remove` function that clears the update timer, which is responsible for periodically updating the table.\n\nThe logger function defines an `update` function that is called periodically by the update timer. If `logStats` is true, the `update` function updates the counts in the table rows based on the `calls` object.\n\nFinally, the logger function calls the `setup` function, sets the `lock` variable to false, and returns an object with three properties: `insertInto`, `update`, and `remove`. These properties can be used to insert the table into a parent element, update the table, and remove the table, respectively.\n\nIn summary, the logger function provides a way to log method calls and their arguments to the console and/or a table for statistical analysis. It overrides several methods on the `document` object and the `Element.prototype` object to log their calls, and also overrides the `data` property on the `Text.prototype` object to log its get and set operations. The logger function provides functions to insert, update, and remove the table, as well as a way to clear the logged method calls. This functionality can be useful for debugging and performance analysis in the larger Preact project.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `logger` function?\n- The `logger` function is responsible for logging method calls and their arguments, as well as updating and displaying statistics in a table.\n\n2. How does the `ConsoleBuffer` class work?\n- The `ConsoleBuffer` class buffers console method calls and replays them at the end of the current stack, using a promise-based approach to defer the flush of the buffer.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `setup` function?\n- The `setup` function is responsible for setting up the statistics table by creating the necessary DOM elements and appending them to the document.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/demo/logger.md"}}],["68",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/demo/mobx.jsx)\n\nThe code provided is a part of the Preact project and it demonstrates the usage of MobX, a state management library, in a Preact application. \n\nThe code begins by importing necessary dependencies from the 'react' and 'mobx' libraries. It also imports the 'mobx-react' library for integrating MobX with React components. Additionally, it imports the 'batchingForReactDom' module from 'mobx-react-lite' to enable batching of React updates.\n\nNext, a class called `Todo` is defined. This class represents a todo item and has properties such as `id`, `title`, and `finished`. The `title` and `finished` properties are decorated as `observable`, which means that any changes to these properties will be automatically tracked by MobX.\n\nThe code then defines a functional component called `Forward` using the `observer` function from `mobx-react`. This component takes a `todo` prop and renders a paragraph element displaying the `title` and `finished` properties of the `todo` object. The component is wrapped in the `forwardRef` function, allowing it to forward a ref to the underlying DOM element.\n\nAn instance of the `Todo` class is created and assigned to the `todo` variable.\n\nNext, two more functional components called `TodoView` and `HookView` are defined. Both of these components are also wrapped in the `observer` function. They take a `todo` prop and render a paragraph element displaying the `title` and `finished` properties of the `todo` object. The `HookView` component uses the `useObserver` hook from `mobx-react` to automatically track changes to the `todo` object.\n\nFinally, the `MobXDemo` function component is exported. This component renders a text input, a paragraph element displaying the success status based on the ref, and the `TodoView`, `Forward`, and `HookView` components. The `onInput` event handler updates the `title` property of the `todo` object and triggers a re-render of the component.\n\nIn summary, this code demonstrates how to use MobX to manage state in a Preact application. It showcases the usage of observable properties, observer components, and the useObserver hook to automatically track and update the UI in response to changes in the state.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this function is to create a new component with a specific appearance.\n\nThe `AddNewComponent` function is exported as the default export of the file, which means it can be imported and used in other files within the project.\n\nThe function uses the `createElement` function from the `react` module to create a new React element. The `createElement` function is a built-in function in React that allows developers to create React elements without using JSX syntax.\n\nThe returned React element is a `<div>` element that contains the text \"AddNewComponent (component #{appearance})\". The `appearance` parameter is interpolated into the text using template literals. This allows the appearance value to be dynamically inserted into the text of the element.\n\nHere is an example of how this `AddNewComponent` function can be used in a larger project:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport AddNewComponent from './AddNewComponent';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to my App</h1>\n      <AddNewComponent appearance={1} />\n      <AddNewComponent appearance={2} />\n      <AddNewComponent appearance={3} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `AddNewComponent` function is imported and used within the `App` component.

This function returns a promise that resolves after a random timeout between 0 and 1000 milliseconds. Once the promise is resolved, the subcomponent is imported from the './subcomponent.jsx' file.\n\nThe `SubComponent` is then rendered within the `ComponentContainer` component by including `<SubComponent />` within the `<div>` element. This will cause the subcomponent to be rendered when the `ComponentContainer` component is rendered.\n\nOverall, the purpose of this code is to provide a container component that generates and displays subcomponents based on a given appearance value.

These functions are used to create React elements, handle lazy loading of components, and create class-based components.\n\nNext, the code defines two functional components called \"Loading\" and \"Error\". The \"Loading\" component simply renders a loading message, while the \"Error\" component displays an error message and a link to reset the application. These components are used as fallbacks when the lazy-loaded components are being loaded or when an error occurs.\n\nThe code then defines four lazy-loaded components: \"DropZone\", \"Editor\", \"AddNewComponent\", and \"GenerateComponents\". These components are loaded asynchronously using the \"lazy\" function and the \"import\" statement. Each component is wrapped in a \"pause\" function, which introduces a random delay before the component is loaded. This delay simulates a loading state and allows for a more realistic user experience.\n\nFinally, the code exports a class-based component called \"App\".

This component is responsible for rendering the main layout of the application, including a navigation menu and a section for displaying user profiles.\n\nThe code begins by importing various dependencies, such as the \"observer\" function from the \"mobx-react\" library, the \"Component\" class from the \"preact\" library, and several other components and modules from the project itself.\n\nThe \"@observer\" decorator is then applied to the \"App\" class, indicating that it is an observable component that will automatically re-render whenever its observed data changes.\n\nThe \"componentDidMount\" method is defined within the \"App\" class and is called after the component has been mounted to the DOM. In this method, the \"loadUsers\" function is called on the \"store\" object, which is imported from the \"store\" module. This function is responsible for fetching user data from an API and updating the \"users\" observable array in the store. If an error occurs during the data loading process, it is logged to the console.\n\nThe \"render\" method is also defined within the \"App\" class and is responsible for rendering the JSX markup that represents the main layout of the application. \n\nThe layout consists of a \"Router\" component, which enables client-side routing, and a \"div\" element with the id \"people-app\" that contains the navigation menu and the main section for displaying user profiles.\n\nThe navigation menu is rendered within a \"nav\" element and includes a dropdown menu for sorting the users by name or ID. The selected sorting option is stored in the \"usersOrder\" observable property of the \"store\" object. When the sorting option is changed, the \"setUsersOrder\" function is called on the \"store\" object to update the sorting order.\n\nThe user profiles are rendered within an \"ul\" element as a list of \"li\" elements. Each \"li\" element represents a user and includes an \"img\" element for displaying the user's avatar and a \"Link\" component for navigating to the user's profile page. The user data is obtained from the \"getSortedUsers\" function on the \"store\" object, which returns an array of users sorted according to the selected sorting option.\n\nThe main section for displaying user profiles is rendered within a \"section\" element with the id \"people-main\". It includes a nested \"Route\" component that matches the \"/people\" route and renders the \"Profile\" component for any sub-routes.\n\nIn summary, this code defines the main component of the Preact application, which renders the main layout of the application, including a navigation menu and a section for displaying user profiles. It also handles the loading of user data and provides functionality for sorting and navigating between user profiles.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `@observer` decorator?\n- The `@observer` decorator is used to make the `App` component reactive to changes in the `store` object. It ensures that the component re-renders whenever there are changes to the observable data in the store.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `store.loadUsers()` method and why is it called in `componentDidMount()`?\n- The `store.loadUsers()` method is responsible for loading user data. It is called in `componentDidMount()` to ensure that the user data is loaded when the component is mounted and ready to be rendered.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Router`, `Link`, and `Route` components imported from './router'?\n- The `Router` component is used to define the routing configuration for the application. The `Link` component is used to create links to different routes within the application. The `Route` component is used to define the rendering of components based on the current route.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/demo/people/index.md"}}],["77",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/demo/people/profile.tsx)\n\nThe code provided is a part of the Preact project and it defines a component called \"Profile\". This component is responsible for rendering a user profile with various details such as name, picture, gender, email, and a button to remove the contact.\n\nThe component extends the \"Component\" class from the Preact library, which allows it to have lifecycle methods such as \"componentDidMount\" and \"componentWillReceiveProps\". It also uses decorators from the \"mobx\" and \"mobx-react\" libraries to make the component observable and to enable reactivity.\n\nThe \"Profile\" component has two observable properties: \"id\" and \"busy\". The \"id\" property represents the ID of the user profile being displayed, and the \"busy\" property indicates whether the component is currently performing an action (e.g., removing a contact).\n\nIn the \"componentDidMount\" method, the \"id\" property is set to the value of the \"route\" property passed to the component. This allows the component to display the correct user profile based on the current route.\n\nThe \"componentWillReceiveProps\" method is called whenever the component receives new props. In this case, it updates the \"id\" property with the new value of the \"route\" prop. This ensures that the component can handle changes in the route and display the corresponding user profile.\n\nThe \"render\" method is responsible for rendering the user profile. It first checks if the \"user\" property (which is a computed property) is null. If it is, the method returns null, indicating that no profile should be displayed. Otherwise, it renders the profile details using JSX syntax.\n\nThe \"user\" property is a computed property that retrieves the user object from the \"store\" based on the current \"id\" value. The \"store\" is imported from another file and is responsible for managing the user data.\n\nThe \"remove\" method is an asynchronous function that is called when the \"Remove contact\" button is clicked. It sets the \"busy\" property to true, simulates a delay of 1.5 seconds using a promise, deletes the user from the \"store\", and finally sets the \"busy\" property back to false.\n\nOverall, this code defines a reusable \"Profile\" component that can be used in the larger Preact project to display user profiles and allow users to remove contacts. The component leverages the MobX library for state management and reactivity, and interacts with a separate \"store\" to retrieve and delete user data.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `@observer` decorator on the `Profile` class?\n- The `@observer` decorator is used to make the `Profile` component reactive to changes in the MobX store, causing it to re-render when relevant data changes.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `@observable` decorator on the `id` and `busy` properties?\n- The `@observable` decorator is used to mark the `id` and `busy` properties as observable, allowing MobX to track their changes and trigger reactivity when they are updated.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `@computed` decorator on the `user` getter?\n- The `@computed` decorator is used to create a computed property called `user`, which is derived from the MobX store's `users` array and the `id` property. It will automatically update whenever the dependencies change.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/demo/people/profile.md"}}],["78",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/demo/people/router.tsx)\n\nThe code provided is a part of the Preact project and it contains several components and hooks that are used for routing and navigation within a Preact application.\n\nThe `Router` component is responsible for managing the current path and providing it to the child components. It uses the `useLocation` hook to listen for changes in the browser's history and update the path accordingly. It also provides a `navigate` function that can be used to programmatically change the path. The `Router` component uses the `RouterContext` to pass the router data down to its child components.\n\nThe `Route` component is used to define routes within the application. It takes a `match` prop which specifies the path pattern that the route should match. If the current path matches the `match` prop, the `Route` component renders its children or the component specified by the `component` prop. It also updates the router data by adding the matched path segment to the `match` array and removing it from the `path` array.\n\nThe `Link` component is used to create links within the application. It adds an active class to the link if the current path matches the `href` prop. It also handles click events on the link and uses the `router.navigate` function to update the path when the link is clicked.\n\nHere is an example of how these components can be used in a Preact application:\n\n```jsx\nimport { h } from 'preact';\nimport { Router, Route, Link } from 'preact-router';\n\nconst Home = () => <h1>Home</h1>;\nconst About = () => <h1>About</h1>;\nconst Contact = () => <h1>Contact</h1>;\n\nconst App = () => (\n  <Router>\n    <nav>\n      <Link href=\"/\">Home</Link>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n      <Link href=\"/contact\">Contact</Link>\n    </nav>\n    <Route match=\"/\" component={Home} />\n    <Route match=\"/about\" component={About} />\n    <Route match=\"/contact\" component={Contact} />\n  </Router>\n);\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Router` component is used to wrap the navigation links and the routes. The `Link` components are used to create the navigation links, and the `Route` components define the routes and the components to render when the path matches.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and flexible routing solution for Preact applications, allowing developers to easily create navigation links and define routes within their applications.\n## Questions: \n **Question 1:** What is the purpose of the `useLocation` function?\n\n**Answer:** The `useLocation` function is used to add an event listener to the `popstate` event, which is triggered when the user navigates through the browser history. It takes a callback function as an argument and executes it when the event is triggered.\n\n**Question 2:** How does the `Router` component handle navigation?\n\n**Answer:** The `Router` component uses the `useLocation` hook to listen for changes in the browser's location. It updates the `path` state variable whenever the location changes. It also provides a `navigate` function that uses the `history.pushState` method to update the browser's URL and triggers a re-render of the component.\n\n**Question 3:** What is the purpose of the `Link` component?\n\n**Answer:** The `Link` component is used to create clickable links that navigate within the application. It adds an event listener to the `click` event and prevents the default behavior of the anchor tag. Instead, it uses the `router.navigate` function to update the browser's URL and trigger a re-render of the `Router` component.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/demo/people/router.md"}}],["79",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/demo/people/store.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a part of the Preact project and it defines a MobX State Tree (MST) store for managing a list of users. \n\nThe code begins by importing necessary dependencies from the 'mobx-state-tree' library. It then defines a helper function `cmp` which takes a function `fn` and returns a comparison function. This comparison function is used to sort the users based on a specific property. \n\nNext, the code defines a model called `User` using the `types.model` function from MST. The `User` model has properties such as `email`, `gender`, `id`, `name`, and `picture`. Each property has a specific type defined using the `types` object from MST. \n\nAfter that, the code defines the main `Store` model using the `types.model` function. The `Store` model has two properties: `users` which is an array of `User` models, and `usersOrder` which is an enumeration that can have values 'name' or 'id'. \n\nThe `Store` model also defines two views: `getSortedUsers` and `getFilteredUsers`. The `getSortedUsers` view returns a sorted copy of the `users` array based on the `usersOrder` property. It uses the `cmp` helper function to sort the users based on either their name or id. \n\nThe `Store` model also defines several actions. The `addUser` action is a generator function that fetches user data from an API and adds it to the `users` array. The `loadUsers` action is similar but it replaces the existing `users` array with the fetched data. The `deleteUser` action removes a user from the `users` array based on their id. The `setUsersOrder` action updates the `usersOrder` property with a new value. \n\nFinally, the code exports the `StoreType` which is the type of the `Store` model instance, and the `store` which is an instance of the `Store` model with initial values for `usersOrder` and `users`. \n\nOverall, this code defines a store for managing a list of users in the Preact project. It provides methods for adding, deleting, and sorting users, and can be used to manage user data in a larger application.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `cmp` function?\n- The `cmp` function is a higher-order function that takes a comparison function `fn` and returns a comparison function that can be used to sort an array of objects based on the result of `fn`.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `Store` model?\n- The `Store` model defines the structure and behavior of the application's data store, including the `users` array and the `usersOrder` enumeration.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `addUser` action?\n- The `addUser` action is a generator function that fetches data from an API and adds the fetched user data to the `users` array in the store.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/demo/people/store.md"}}],["80",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/demo/people/styles/animations.scss)\n\nThis code defines three different keyframe animations: `popup`, `zoom`, and `appear-from-left`. Keyframe animations allow for the creation of complex animations by specifying a series of keyframes and the properties that should be applied at each keyframe.\n\nThe `popup` animation is used to create a popup effect. It starts with a box shadow and opacity of 0, and a scale of 0.9. As the animation progresses, the box shadow becomes more pronounced, the opacity increases to 1, and the scale returns to its original value of 1.\n\nThe `zoom` animation is used to create a zoom effect. It starts with an opacity of 0 and a scale of 0.8. As the animation progresses, the opacity increases to 1 and the scale returns to its original value of 1.\n\nThe `appear-from-left` animation is used to create an appearance effect from the left side of the screen. It starts with an opacity of 0 and a translation of -25px on the x-axis. As the animation progresses, the opacity increases to 1 and the translation returns to its original value of 0.\n\nThese keyframe animations can be used in conjunction with CSS selectors to apply the animations to specific elements on a webpage. For example, the `popup` animation could be applied to a modal window to create a smooth transition when the modal is displayed. The `zoom` animation could be applied to an image to create a zoom-in effect when the image is hovered over. The `appear-from-left` animation could be applied to a navigation menu to create a sliding-in effect when the menu is opened.\n\nOverall, this code provides a set of reusable keyframe animations that can be used to enhance the visual experience of a webpage. By defining these animations in a separate file, they can be easily referenced and applied to different elements throughout the project.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `popup` keyframe animation?\n- The `popup` keyframe animation is used to create a pop-up effect by gradually increasing the box shadow, opacity, and scale of an element.\n\n2. What does the `zoom` keyframe animation do?\n- The `zoom` keyframe animation is used to gradually increase the opacity and scale of an element, creating a zoom-in effect.\n\n3.

The purpose of this code is to define the visual appearance and layout of the \"people-app\" component.\n\nThe \"people-app\" component is a container element that represents a section of the larger web application. It has a relative positioning and a minimum height of 100vh (viewport height), which ensures that it takes up at least the full height of the viewport. It also has an animation called \"popup\" that lasts for 300ms and uses a cubic-bezier timing function. This animation is applied when the component is displayed or shown.\n\nThe component has a background color defined by the CSS variable \"--app-background\". It also defines two CSS variables \"--menu-width\" and \"--menu-item-height\" that can be used to control the width and height of the menu within the component.\n\nInside the \"people-app\" component, there is a nested \"nav\" element that represents a navigation menu. The \"nav\" element has a fixed width defined by the \"--menu-width\" variable and a height of 100%. It has a background color defined by the CSS variable \"--app-background-secondary\". The menu items within the navigation menu are displayed vertically and can be scrolled if they overflow the available space.\n\nEach menu item is represented by an \"li\" element and has a width of 100%. The menu items have a zoom animation that lasts for 200ms and is applied when they are displayed. They also have a transparent border and rounded corners. When a menu item is hovered over, it changes its background color to \"--app-highlight\".\n\nThe menu items also have a pseudo-element \"::after\" that is positioned on top of the menu item. This pseudo-element has a radial gradient background that creates a ripple effect when the menu item is clicked. The ripple effect is achieved by changing the size and opacity of the pseudo-element.\n\nThe \"people-main\" element is a sibling of the \"nav\" element and represents the main content area of the \"people-app\" component. It has a left padding equal to the width of the navigation menu, which ensures that the content is not obscured by the menu.\n\nIn summary, this code defines the visual appearance and layout of a component called \"people-app\" in a web application. It includes a navigation menu with styled menu items and a main content area. The code can be used to style and layout the \"people-app\" component within the larger project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of the `@media (min-width: 1280px)` rule?\n- The `@media (min-width: 1280px)` rule sets specific styles for the `#people-app` element when the viewport width is equal to or greater than 1280px.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `> nav li > a::after` selector?\n- The `> nav li > a::after` selector is used to add a radial gradient background effect to the `a` elements within the `li` elements inside the `nav` element.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/demo/people/styles/app.md"}}],["82",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/demo/people/styles/avatar.scss)\n\nThis code is a CSS stylesheet that defines the styling for an avatar component in a web application. The avatar component is used to display a small image or icon that represents a user or a profile picture.\n\nThe code is written using CSS selectors and properties. The `#people-app` selector targets an element with the id \"people-app\", which is likely the container element for the avatar component. The `.avatar` selector targets any element with the class \"avatar\" that is a descendant of the element with the id \"people-app\".\n\nThe CSS properties within the `.avatar` selector define the visual appearance of the avatar component. Here is a breakdown of each property:\n\n- `display: inline-block;`: This property sets the display behavior of the avatar component to be an inline block element. This allows other elements to be displayed next to it horizontally.\n\n- `overflow: hidden;`: This property hides any content that exceeds the dimensions of the avatar component. This is useful if the avatar image is larger than the specified width and height.\n\n- `width: var(--avatar-size, 32px);` and `height: var(--avatar-size, 32px);`: These properties set the width and height of the avatar component. The values are defined using CSS variables, which allow for dynamic sizing based on the value of the `--avatar-size` variable. If the variable is not defined, the default value of 32px is used.\n\n- `background-color: var(--avatar-color, var(--app-primary));`: This property sets the background color of the avatar component. It uses another CSS variable, `--avatar-color`, to define the color. If the variable is not defined, it falls back to the value of `--app-primary`, which is likely a global variable defined elsewhere in the project.\n\n- `border-radius: 50%;`: This property sets the border radius of the avatar component to create a circular shape.\n\n- `font-size: calc(var(--avatar-size, 32px) * 0.5);`: This property sets the font size of the text inside the avatar component. It uses the same `--avatar-size` variable to calculate the font size as half of the avatar size.\n\n- `line-height: var(--avatar-size, 32px);`: This property sets the line height of the text inside the avatar component to be the same as the avatar size. This ensures that the text is vertically centered within the component.\n\n- `object-fit: cover;`: This property specifies how the avatar image should be resized to fit within the component. The \"cover\" value scales the image to cover the entire component while maintaining its aspect ratio.\n\n- `text-align: center;`: This property centers the text horizontally within the avatar component.\n\n- `text-transform: uppercase;`: This property transforms the text inside the avatar component to uppercase.\n\n- `white-space: nowrap;`: This property prevents the text inside the avatar component from wrapping to the next line.\n\nOverall, this code defines the visual styling for an avatar component in a web application. It allows for dynamic sizing, customizable colors, and ensures that the text is properly aligned and formatted within the component. This code can be used in the larger project by applying the \"avatar\" class to the appropriate elements that need to display avatars. For example:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"people-app\">\n  <div class=\"avatar\">\n    <img src=\"avatar.jpg\" alt=\"User Avatar\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this example, the avatar component is used within a container element with the id \"people-app\". The avatar image is specified using an `<img>` tag within the avatar component. The CSS styles defined in the code will be applied to the avatar component, resulting in the desired visual appearance.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `people-app` ID selector? \n- The `people-app` ID selector is used to target a specific element in the HTML markup with the ID of `people-app` and apply CSS styles to it.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `avatar` class selector? \n- The `avatar` class selector is used to target elements with the class of `avatar` and apply CSS styles to them. It is likely used to style avatar images or elements in the application.\n\n3. What are the values of the CSS custom properties `--avatar-size`, `--avatar-color`, and `--app-primary`? \n- The values of these CSS custom properties are not provided in the given code snippet.

It sets several CSS properties to define the button's appearance, such as position, size, padding, border, background color, border radius, font properties, and text styling. It also includes transitions for smooth animations when the button is interacted with.\n\nThe code then defines pseudo-elements `::before` and `::after` to create visual effects when the button is hovered over or clicked. The `::before` pseudo-element creates a background overlay that appears when the button is hovered over, while the `::after` pseudo-element creates a radial gradient background that expands when the button is clicked.\n\nThe code also includes additional CSS selectors to define different styles for specific button classes. For example, the `.primary` class sets a different background color and box shadow for primary buttons, while the `.secondary` class does the same for secondary buttons. The `:disabled` selector is used to define the appearance of disabled buttons.\n\nLastly, the code includes an animation called `stripes` using the `@keyframes` rule. This animation creates a moving stripes effect on buttons with the `.busy` class.\n\nOverall, this code provides a consistent and visually appealing style for buttons in the web application. It can be used by applying the appropriate classes to buttons in the HTML markup, allowing developers to easily create buttons with consistent styling throughout the project.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"people-app\">\n  <button class=\"primary\">Submit</button>\n  <button class=\"secondary\">Cancel</button>\n  <button class=\"primary disabled busy\">Loading</button>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn the above example, three buttons are created within an element with the ID `people-app`. The first button has the `primary` class, the second button has the `secondary` class, and the third button has the `primary`, `disabled`, and `busy` classes. Each button will have the corresponding styling defined in the CSS code.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `button::before` and `button::after` pseudo-elements?\n- The `button::before` pseudo-element is used to create a background ripple effect when the button is hovered. The `button::after` pseudo-element is used to create a radial gradient animation when the button is clicked.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `button.busy` class?\n- The `button.busy` class is used to style a button that is in a busy/loading state. It applies a background gradient animation and changes the color of the button text.\n\n3.

It is responsible for importing and styling various SCSS files, defining CSS variables, and setting global styles for the application.\n\nThe code begins by importing several SCSS files using the `@import` directive. These files likely contain styles specific to different components or sections of the application, such as the app itself, animations, avatars, profiles, and buttons.\n\nNext, the code defines CSS variables using the `:root` selector. These variables are used to define colors, sizes, and other properties that can be reused throughout the application. For example, `--app-background` defines the background color of the app, `--app-primary` defines the primary color, and `--spinner-size` defines the size of a spinner element.\n\nThe code then sets global styles for all elements using the `*` selector. The `box-sizing` property is set to `border-box`, which ensures that the width and height of an element includes its padding and border. This prevents elements from overflowing their containers. \n\nNext, the code sets styles for the `#people-app` element, which is likely the main container for the application. The `display` property is set to `flow-root`, which establishes a new block formatting context and prevents margin collapsing. The `overflow` property is set to `auto`, which adds scrollbars when the content overflows the container. The `min-height` property is set to `100vh`, which ensures that the container takes up at least the full height of the viewport. The `margin` property is set to `0`, which removes any margin around the container. The `animation` property is set to `background-light 5s ease-out forwards`, which applies a background animation to the container. Finally, the `background` property is set to a series of radial and linear gradients, creating a fancy background effect.\n\nThe code also sets styles for the `.spinner` class within the `#people-app` element. This class is likely used to display a loading spinner. The `position` property is set to `absolute`, which positions the spinner relative to its closest positioned ancestor. The `top` and `left` properties are used to center the spinner horizontally and vertically within the container. The `width` and `height` properties are set to the value of the `--spinner-size` variable, which determines the size of the spinner. The `animation` property is set to `zoom 250ms 500ms forwards ease-out`, which applies a zoom animation to the spinner. The `opacity` property is set to `0`, which initially hides the spinner. The `transition` property is set to `opacity 200ms, transform 200ms ease-in`, which adds a smooth transition effect when the spinner is shown or hidden.\n\nThe code also defines keyframes for the `spinner` animation. This animation is applied to the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements of the spinner. The keyframes define different transformations and rotations at different percentages of the animation duration, creating a spinning effect.\n\nFinally, the code sets some additional styles for `ul`, `ol`, and `a` elements within the `#people-app` container. These styles remove the default padding and list-style for lists, and set the color and text-decoration for links.\n\nOverall, this code is responsible for importing and styling various SCSS files, defining CSS variables, and setting global styles for the Preact application. It provides a consistent and visually appealing look and feel for the entire application.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `@import` statements at the beginning of the code? \n   - The `@import` statements are used to import external SCSS files into the current file, allowing the styles defined in those files to be used in the current file.\n\n2.

In this code, the `vnode` property of the `options` object is modified to transform vnodes by setting the `nodeName` property to the `type` property and the `attributes` property to the `props` property. Additionally, the `children` property is set to an array of child vnodes or an empty array if no children are present.\n\nThe `asArray` function is a utility function that takes an argument `arr` and returns an array. If `arr` is already an array, it is returned as is. Otherwise, it is wrapped in an array and returned.\n\nThe `normalize` function is another utility function that takes an argument `obj` and normalizes it. If `obj` is an array, each element is recursively normalized using the `normalize` function. If `obj` has a `type` property but no `attributes` property, the `attributes` property is set to the `props` property. Finally, the `obj` is returned.\n\nThe `Component` function is a custom component class that extends the `CevicheComponent` class from Preact. It takes `props` and `context` as arguments and calls the `CevicheComponent` constructor with these arguments. It then overrides the `render` method of the `CevicheComponent` class to modify the `props` object before calling the original `render` method. If `props.children` is present, it is normalized using the `normalize` function and converted to an array using the `asArray` function. The modified `props` object is then passed to the original `render` method.\n\nThe `createElement`, `h`, `cloneElement`, and `render` functions are all imported from the Preact library and are exported from this module. These functions are commonly used in Preact applications to create and render virtual DOM elements.\n\nOverall, this code provides utility functions for normalizing and transforming vnodes, as well as a custom component class that extends the base Preact component class.

What is the purpose of the `normalize` function?\n- The `normalize` function is used to normalize the structure of an object. If the object is an array, it recursively calls `normalize` on each element of the array.

The `onClick` method is responsible for updating the counter in the component's state when a button is clicked.\n\nThe `componentDidMount` lifecycle method is overridden to set two properties on the `options` object from the `preact` library. These properties are `_diff` and `diffed`. The `_diff` property is a function that is called before the diffing process of the virtual DOM. It sets the `startTime` property on the virtual DOM node to the current time using the `performance.now()` method. The `diffed` property is a function that is called after the diffing process is complete. It sets the `endTime` property on the virtual DOM node to the current time. These properties are used for profiling the rendering performance of components.\n\nThe `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method is overridden to delete the `_diff` and `diffed` properties from the `options` object. This is done to clean up the component before it is unmounted.\n\nThe `render` method of the `ProfilerDemo` component returns a JSX template that represents the structure of the rendered component. It includes various child components such as `Foo`, `PrimeNumber`, and `Bar`. These components are used to demonstrate different rendering speeds. The `PrimeNumber` component calls the `getPrimes` function with an argument of 10, which slows down the rendering of this component.

It also has a `realMax` variable that represents the maximum level of the tree.\n\nThe class has a `svgRef` method that is used to store a reference to the SVG element in the `this.svgElement` property. It also has two scaling functions, `scaleFactor` and `scaleLean`, which are used to scale the height factor and lean factor based on the mouse position.\n\nThe class has an `onMouseMove` method that is called when the mouse moves over the SVG element. It uses the `d3mouse` function to get the mouse coordinates relative to the SVG element and updates the state with the scaled height and lean factors.\n\nThe class has a `restart` method that resets the current maximum level of the tree to 0 and calls the `next` method. The `next` method increments the current maximum level and sets a timer to call itself again after 500 milliseconds, until the maximum level is reached.\n\nThe class has lifecycle methods `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount` that are called when the component is mounted and unmounted, respectively. In `componentDidMount`, it selects the SVG element using `d3select` and attaches a `mousemove` event listener to it. It also calls the `next` method. In `componentWillUnmount`, it removes the `mousemove` event listener and clears the timer.\n\nThe `render` method is responsible for rendering the component. It returns a `div` element with a `svg` child element. The `svg` element has a `width` and `height` attribute based on the `svg` object in the class. It also has a `ref` attribute that references the `svgRef` method. Inside the `svg` element, there is a `Pythagoras` component that receives various props, including the base width, height factor, lean factor, and the current maximum level of the tree.\n\nOverall, this code sets up a Pythagoras tree visualization and allows the user to interact with it by moving the mouse.

It takes in a value in radians and multiplies it by the conversion factor of 180 divided by PI to get the equivalent value in degrees.\n\nThe `memoizedCalc` function is a memoization function that calculates and stores the values of certain properties of the Pythagoras tree based on the input arguments. It takes in an object with properties `w`, `heightFactor`, and `lean`, and calculates the values of `nextRight`, `nextLeft`, `A`, and `B`. It uses these values to construct a result object and stores it in a memo object using a memoKey generated from the input arguments. If the memoKey already exists in the memo object, the function returns the stored result object instead of recalculating it. This memoization technique helps improve performance by avoiding redundant calculations.\n\nThe `Pythagoras` function is the main function responsible for rendering the Pythagoras tree. It takes in several properties including `w` (width), `x` and `y` coordinates, `heightFactor`, `lean`, `left`, `right`, `lvl` (current level), and `maxlvl` (maximum level). \n\nThe function first checks if the current level (`lvl`) is greater than or equal to the maximum level (`maxlvl`) or if the width (`w`) is less than 1. If either of these conditions is true, it returns `null`, indicating that no further rendering is needed.\n\nIf the conditions are not met, the function proceeds to calculate the values of `nextRight`, `nextLeft`, `A`, and `B` by calling the `memoizedCalc` function with the appropriate arguments.\n\nBased on the values of `left` and `right`, the function determines the rotation angle (`rotate`) for the current Pythagoras tree element.\n\nThe function then returns a `<g>` SVG element with a transformation that includes a translation based on the `x` and `y` coordinates and the rotation angle. Inside the `<g>` element, a `<rect>` SVG element is rendered with the width and height set to `w` and the fill color set based on the current level (`lvl`) divided by the maximum level (`maxlvl`).\n\nThe function then recursively calls itself twice, passing in the calculated `nextLeft` and `nextRight` values as the new `w` values, and updating the `x` and `y` coordinates accordingly. This recursion continues until the maximum level is reached or the width becomes less than 1.\n\nOverall, this code is a crucial part of the Preact project as it defines the logic for rendering a Pythagoras tree. It uses memoization to optimize performance by avoiding redundant calculations, and recursively renders the tree elements based on the input properties.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `memoizedCalc` function and how does it work?\n- The `memoizedCalc` function is used to memoize calculations for efficiency. It stores previously calculated results in a memo object using a unique key generated from the function arguments.

It takes in several input parameters including `w` (width), `x` and `y` coordinates, `heightFactor`, `lean`, `left`, `right`, `lvl` (current level), and `maxlvl` (maximum level). It recursively generates and renders rectangles representing the Pythagoras tree.\n\n3.

If `pendingId` is null, it is set to a random value.\n\nThe `Child` component also defines an `onInput` function that is called when the user types in the input field. This function updates the `items` state based on the value of `childFirst`. If `childFirst` is true, the `pendingId` is set to null and the `items` state is updated. Otherwise, the `items` state is updated first and then the `pendingId` is set to null.\n\nThe `Child` component renders a `div` element that contains a list of input fields, one for each item in the `items` array. Each input field has an `onInput` event handler that updates the corresponding item in the `items` array. There is also an input field with a placeholder that allows the user to add new items. When the user types in this input field, the `onInput` function is called.\n\nOverall, this code demonstrates how to manage state and handle user input in Preact using hooks. It shows how to update state variables and how to handle user input events. This code can be used as a reference for implementing similar functionality in other components of the Preact project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of the `Child` component and how does it handle state updates?\n- The `Child` component is responsible for rendering a list of input elements and an input field for adding new items. It handles state updates by using the `useState` and `useCallback` hooks to manage the `items` and `pendingId` state variables.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Parent` component and how does it use the `Child` component?\n- The `Parent` component is responsible for rendering the `Config` and `Child` components.

It sets the height to 100% and applies a background color, font, and color. It also sets some styles for the `.app` class, which represents the main container of the application. It sets the height to 100% and defines the layout as a column.\n\nInside the `.app` class, there is a `header` element that contains a navigation menu. The styles for the `header` element include a background color, box shadow, and padding. The `nav` element inside the `header` is displayed as an inline block and has some padding. The `a` elements inside the `nav` element are styled as inline blocks with margin, padding, background color, border radius, and color. There are also hover and active styles defined for the `a` elements.\n\nThe `.app` class also contains a `main` element, which represents the main content of the application.

It provides a way to create reusable and composable styled components. In this code, the `styled` function from `styled-components` is used to create two styled components: `Button` and `Container`.\n\nThe `Button` component is created by calling the `styled.button` function. It is a styled version of the HTML `button` element. The CSS properties defined within the template literal are applied to the `Button` component. These properties define the appearance of the button, such as the background color, border, color, margin, and padding. \n\nThe `Container` component is created in a similar way using the `styled.div` function. It is a styled version of the HTML `div` element. The `text-align` property is set to `center`, which will center align the content within the `Container`.\n\nThe `StyledComp` function is the default export of this module. It returns a JSX element that renders the `Container` component. Inside the `Container`, two instances of the `Button` component are rendered. The first button is a normal button, while the second button has the `primary` prop set to `true`. \n\nThe `primary` prop is used within the `Button` component to conditionally apply additional CSS properties. If the `primary` prop is `true`, the `background` property is set to `palevioletred` and the `color` property is set to `white`. This allows for easy customization of the button's appearance based on the prop values passed to it.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger Preact project to create styled components with custom CSS properties. It provides a way to encapsulate styles within components and make them reusable throughout the project. Developers can easily create and customize styled components by passing props to them. For example, they can create different variations of buttons by passing different prop values to the `Button` component.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This is particularly useful when dealing with large applications where loading all components upfront can lead to slower initial load times. \n\nThe code begins by importing the `Suspense` and `lazy` components from the `react` package, as well as the `Router`, `Route`, and `Switch` components from a custom `simple-router` module. \n\nNext, the code defines two variables, `Hello` and `Bye`, which are assigned the result of calling the `lazy` function with import statements for the respective component files (`hello.jsx` and `bye.jsx`). This lazy loading technique allows the components to be loaded asynchronously when needed, rather than upfront.\n\nThe code then defines a functional component called `Loading`, which simply renders a loading message.\n\nFinally, the code exports a default functional component called `SuspenseRouterBug`. This component renders a `Router` component from the custom `simple-router` module, and within it, a `Suspense` component. The `Suspense` component takes a `fallback` prop, which is set to the `Loading` component. This means that while the components are being loaded asynchronously, the `Loading` component will be displayed as a fallback UI.\n\nWithin the `Suspense` component, a `Switch` component is used to conditionally render the `Hello` component when the path is `/`, and the `Bye` component when the path is `/bye`. The `exact` prop is used on the first `Route` component to ensure that it only matches the exact path.\n\nOverall, this code demonstrates how to use the `Suspense` and `lazy` features in React to handle code splitting and lazy loading of components, improving the performance of the application by only loading components when they are needed.\n## Questions: \n 1.

These dependencies are used to create and manage the router functionality.\n\nThe code then defines an object called `memoryHistory`, which serves as a basic implementation of a history object. It contains an array called `listeners` that stores history listeners. These listeners are functions that will be called whenever the `navigate` function is invoked. The `navigate` function iterates over the `listeners` array and calls each listener with the provided `to` location.\n\nNext, the code creates a context called `RouterContext` using the `createContext` function from React. This context is used to provide the router functionality to child components.\n\nThe `Router` component is then defined. It takes two props: `history` and `children`. The `history` prop is set to `memoryHistory` by default. The component uses the `useState` hook to create a state variable called `location`, which is initially set to `{ pathname: '/' }`. The `useLayoutEffect` hook is used to add a listener to the `history` object. This listener updates the `location` state whenever a new location is received. The `Router` component renders a `RouterContext.Provider` component, which provides the `history` and `location` values to its children.\n\nThe `Switch` component is defined next. It uses the `useContext` hook to access the `location` value from the `RouterContext`. It then iterates over its children using the `Children.forEach` function from React. It checks if the `path` prop of each child matches the current `location.pathname`. If a match is found, the corresponding child element is assigned to the `element` variable. Finally, the `Switch` component returns the `element`.\n\nThe `Route` component is a simple component that renders its children. It takes three props: `children`, `path`, and `exact`. It is used to define routes within the application.\n\nThe `Link` component is used to create links within the application. It takes two props: `to` and `children`. It uses the `useContext` hook to access the `history` value from the `RouterContext`. It also defines an `onClick` event handler that prevents the default link behavior, stops event propagation, and calls the `navigate` function of the `history` object with the provided `to` location. The `Link` component renders an anchor element with the `to` prop as the `href` attribute and the provided `children` as its content.\n\nOverall, this code provides the basic functionality for routing within a Preact application.

These components and functions are used to create and manage components in the Preact project.\n\nThe code defines a functional component called `LazyComp` which returns a simple `<div>` element with the text \"I'm (fake) lazy loaded\". \n\nThe code then uses the `lazy` function from the 'react' library to create a lazy-loaded component called `Lazy`. The `lazy` function takes a function as an argument, which returns a promise that resolves to an object with a `default` property that contains the lazy-loaded component. In this case, the function returns a promise that immediately resolves to an object with the `default` property set to the `LazyComp` component.\n\nThe code also defines a function called `createSuspension` which takes three arguments: `name`, `timeout`, and `error`. This function returns an object with several methods and properties. The `start` method starts a timeout and returns a promise that resolves or rejects after the specified `timeout` period. The `getPromise` method returns the promise created by the `start` method. The `isDone` method returns a boolean indicating whether the promise has resolved or rejected.\n\nThe code defines a functional component called `CustomSuspense` which takes several props including `isDone`, `start`, `timeout`, and `name`.

The `onRerun` method sets the state to the result of calling the `init` function. The `render` method renders a `<div>` element with several child components, including the lazy-loaded `Lazy` component wrapped in a `Suspense` component, and multiple instances of the `CustomSuspense` component wrapped in nested `Suspense` components. \n\nOverall, this code demonstrates the usage of lazy loading and suspense in Preact. The `lazy` function allows for the lazy loading of components, which can improve performance by only loading components when they are needed.

The path mappings are used to resolve module imports, allowing the code to reference the \"preact/hooks\" and \"preact\" modules using their respective file paths.\n\nHere is an example of how this configuration file might be used in a larger Preact project:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-preact-app\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"tsc\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"typescript\": \"^4.0.3\",\n    \"preact\": \"^10.5.13\"\n  },\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n    \"jsx\": \"react\",\n    \"jsxFactory\": \"h\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"target\": \"es2018\",\n    \"module\": \"es2015\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"preact/hooks\": [\"../hooks/src/index.js\"],\n      \"preact\": [\"../src/index.js\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the configuration file is included in the project's `package.json` file. The `\"build\"` script runs the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) with the specified configuration options. The project has a dependency on Preact (`preact`), which will be resolved using the path mappings specified in the configuration file.\n\nOverall, this configuration file ensures that the Preact project is compiled correctly and provides the necessary options and mappings for the TypeScript compiler to work effectively.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the \"experimentalDecorators\" option?**\nThe \"experimentalDecorators\" option enables the use of experimental decorators in the code. Decorators are a proposed feature in JavaScript that allow you to modify the behavior of a class or method.\n\n2. **What is the significance of the \"jsx\" and \"jsxFactory\" options?**\nThe \"jsx\" option specifies the syntax to be used for JSX in the code, in this case, it is set to \"react\". The \"jsxFactory\" option specifies the function to be used as the JSX factory, in this case, it is set to \"h\".\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the \"paths\" configuration?**\nThe \"paths\" configuration allows the developer to define custom module resolution paths.

Vite is a fast build tool that is optimized for modern JavaScript frameworks like Preact. The purpose of this code is to configure Vite's behavior during the build process.\n\nThe code begins by importing the `defineConfig` function from the 'vite' module and the `path` module from Node.js. The `defineConfig` function is used to define the configuration options for Vite, while the `path` module is used to manipulate file paths.\n\nThe `root` variable is then defined as the path to the root directory of the project. This is done by joining the current directory (`__dirname`) with the parent directory (`..`). The `resolvePkg` function is also defined, which is used to resolve the path to a specific package within the project.\n\nThe code then exports a configuration object using the `defineConfig` function. This configuration object specifies various options for Vite. \n\nThe `optimizeDeps` option is used to exclude certain dependencies from the optimization process. In this case, several Preact and React dependencies are excluded, such as 'preact', 'preact/compat', 'react', and 'react-dom'. This means that these dependencies will not be transformed or minified during the build process.\n\nThe `resolve` option is used to configure module resolution. It specifies aliases for certain module paths. For example, the alias `'preact/debug/src/debug'` is set to the path of the debug module within the Preact project. This allows the code to import the debug module using the alias instead of the full path.\n\nThe `esbuild` option is used to configure the behavior of the ESBuild bundler. It specifies that JSX syntax should be automatically transformed and that the import source for JSX should be set to 'preact'.\n\nOverall, this code is responsible for configuring Vite's behavior during the build process in the Preact project. It sets options for dependency optimization, module resolution, and JSX transformation. These configurations ensure that the build process is efficient and optimized for Preact development.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `useState`, `useReducer`, and `useRef` hooks are commonly used hooks in React.\n\nThe purpose of this function is to provide a way for developers to give a custom name to these hooks when they are displayed in the devtools panel. By default, the devtools panel displays the name of the hook function itself, but this function allows developers to override that default name with a custom name of their choosing.\n\nThe function takes two parameters: `value` and `name`. The `value` parameter represents the wrapped native hook, which can be either a `useState`, `useReducer`, or `useRef` hook. The `name` parameter is the custom name that the developer wants to assign to the hook.\n\nThe function returns the same `value` that was passed in, but with the custom name applied. This allows the developer to continue using the hook with the custom name in their code.\n\nHere is an example of how this function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { addHookName } from 'Preact';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const customState = addHookName(useState('initial'), 'customState');\n\n  // The customState hook will now be displayed as 'customState' in the devtools panel\n  // instead of 'useState'\n  \n  return (\n    // ...\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useState` hook is wrapped with the `addHookName` function and given the custom name `'customState'`. As a result, when the component is inspected in the devtools panel, the hook will be displayed as `'customState'` instead of `'useState'`. This can be useful for providing more descriptive names for hooks, especially in larger projects where there may be many hooks used.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of this function?**\nThis function is used to customize the displayed name of a useState, useReducer, or useRef hook in the devtools panel.\n\n2. **What are the parameters of this function?**\nThe function takes two parameters: `value`, which is the wrapped native hook, and `name`, which is the custom name that will be displayed in the devtools panel.\n\n3. **What is the return type of this function?**\nThe return type of this function is the same as the type of the `value` parameter.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/devtools/src/index.d.md"}}],["109",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/devtools/src/index.js)\n\nThe code provided is a function called `addHookName` that is used to display a custom label for a custom hook in the devtools panel. \n\nThe function takes in two parameters: `value` and `name`.

This code addresses this issue by providing a way to specify a regular expression pattern for matching protected/private properties and a list of reserved property names that should not be mangled.\n\nThe `minify` object contains a `mangle` object, which in turn contains a `properties` object. The `properties` object has two properties: `regex` and `reserved`. \n\nThe `regex` property is a regular expression pattern that is used to match protected/private properties.

This pattern is commonly used to indicate protected/private properties in JavaScript.\n\nThe `reserved` property is an array of reserved property names that should not be mangled.

React hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components, instead of having to use class components.\n\nThe code includes several commonly used hooks such as `useState`, `useReducer`, `useRef`, `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useContext`, `useDebugValue`, `useErrorBoundary`, and `useId`. Each hook serves a specific purpose and provides a way to manage different aspects of a component's behavior.\n\nFor example, the `useState` hook allows developers to add state to a functional component. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state. Here's an example usage of `useState`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState } from 'preact/hooks';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects in a component, such as fetching data from an API or subscribing to events. It takes a function as its first argument, which will be executed after the component has rendered. The second argument is an optional array of dependencies, which determines when the effect should be re-run. Here's an example usage of `useEffect`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useEffect, useState } from 'preact/hooks';\n\nfunction Timer() {\n  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const interval = setInterval(() => {\n      setSeconds((prevSeconds) => prevSeconds + 1);\n    }, 1000);\n\n    return () => {\n      clearInterval(interval);\n    };\n  }, []);\n\n  return <p>Seconds: {seconds}</p>;\n}\n```\n\nThe other hooks in the code have similar purposes and can be used to manage different aspects of a component's behavior. They provide a way to handle state, perform side effects, access context, and more.\n\nOverall, this code provides a comprehensive set of hooks that can be used to build complex and interactive components in a Preact project. Developers can use these hooks to manage state, handle side effects, and optimize performance in their functional components.\n## Questions: \n **Question 1:** What is the purpose of the `useState` function?\n\n**Answer:** The `useState` function is used to create a stateful value and a function to update it. It can take an initial value or a function that returns the initial value.\n\n**Question 2:** How does `useReducer` differ from `useState`?\n\n**Answer:** `useReducer` is an alternative to `useState` that is usually preferred when there is complex state logic involving multiple sub-values. It allows for optimization of performance for components that trigger deep updates by passing down a `dispatch` function instead of callbacks.\n\n**Question 3:** What is the purpose of the `useRef` function?\n\n**Answer:** The `useRef` function returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument.

The `children` property in the `props` parameter is an array of child elements.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `jsxs` function:\n\n```jsx\nimport { jsxs } from 'Preact';\n\nconst element = jsxs('div', { className: 'container' }, [\n  jsx('h1', null, 'Title'),\n  jsx('p', null, 'Content'),\n]);\n```\n\nThe `jsxDEV` function is similar to the `jsx` function, but it is used in development mode to provide better error messages and debugging information.\n\nThe `Fragment` component is also exported. It is a special component that allows developers to group multiple elements without adding an extra DOM node.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `Fragment` component:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Fragment } from 'Preact';\n\nconst element = (\n  <Fragment>\n    <h1>Title</h1>\n    <p>Content</p>\n  </Fragment>\n);\n```\n\nLastly, the `JSX` type is exported, which is an internal type used by the JSX compiler.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way for developers to write JSX syntax and manipulate the virtual DOM in the Preact project. It simplifies the process of creating and rendering components in a Preact application.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `jsx` function and its variations?\n- The `jsx` function and its variations are used to create virtual DOM nodes in Preact, allowing developers to write JSX syntax and have it transpiled into function calls that create virtual DOM nodes.\n\n2. What are the parameters accepted by the `jsx` function and its variations?\n- The `jsx` function and its variations accept parameters such as `type` (string or ComponentType), `props` (attributes and children), and `key` (optional string). The specific types of the parameters are defined in the code.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `JSXInternal` import and export?\n- The `JSXInternal` import and export are used to provide type definitions for JSX attributes and elements in Preact. It allows for type checking and validation of JSX syntax in Preact components.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/jsx-runtime/src/index.d.md"}}],["115",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/jsx-runtime/src/index.js)\n\nThe code in this file is responsible for exporting various methods that implement Babel's \"automatic\" JSX runtime API. These methods are used for creating JSX elements in a Preact project.\n\nThe main function in this file is `createVNode`, which is a JSX element factory used by Babel's `{runtime:\"automatic\"}` JSX transform. It takes in several parameters: `type`, `props`, `key`, `isStaticChildren`, `__source`, and `__self`. It then creates and returns a virtual node (VNode) object.\n\nThe VNode object represents a virtual representation of a DOM element or component in the Preact project. It contains properties such as `type` (the type of the element or component), `props` (the properties of the element or component), `key` (a unique identifier for the element or component), and `ref` (a reference to the element or component).\n\nThe `createVNode` function also normalizes the props by separating the `ref` property from the other properties. It then checks if the `type` is a component and applies any default props if they exist.\n\nFinally, the `createVNode` function calls the `options.vnode` function if it exists. This allows for customization and hooking into the creation of VNodes in the Preact project.\n\nThe `createVNode` function is exported as `jsx`, `jsxs`, and `jsxDEV`, which allows for different ways of creating JSX elements depending on the needs of the project. The `Fragment` object is also exported, which is a special type of VNode used for grouping multiple elements without adding an extra DOM node.\n\nOverall, this code is an essential part of the Preact project as it provides the functionality for creating JSX elements and VNodes.

It creates and returns a virtual node (VNode) with the specified type, props, key, and other properties.\n\n2. How does the `createVNode` function handle the `ref` prop?\n- The `createVNode` function checks if the `ref` prop exists in the `props` object. If it does, it assigns the value of `ref` to a separate variable and removes the `ref` key from the `normalizedProps` object.\n\n3. What happens if the `type` parameter of the `createVNode` function is a function and has `defaultProps` defined?\n- If the `type` parameter is a function and has `defaultProps` defined, the `createVNode` function checks if any of the normalized props are undefined.

It is a function called `create` that takes in an object `params` as a parameter. The `params` object contains two properties: `github` and `context`. \n\nThe `github` property is a function that returns an instance of the `Octokit` class from the `@actions/github` library. This instance is used to make API requests to the GitHub REST API. The `context` property is an object that contains information about the current GitHub repository and the event that triggered the action.\n\nThe function starts by retrieving the commit SHA and the tag name from the environment variables `GITHUB_SHA` and `GITHUB_REF_NAME` respectively. It then logs the tag name to the console.\n\nNext, it initializes a variable `releaseResult` to store the result of the release creation. It uses the `github.paginate.iterator` method to retrieve all the releases for the repository using the `github.rest.repos.listReleases` method. It iterates over the pages of releases and checks if any release has a `tag_name` that matches the current tag name. If a matching release is found, it logs the release to the console and assigns it to the `releaseResult` variable.\n\nIf no existing release is found, it logs a message indicating that a new draft release will be created. It then calls the `github.rest.repos.createRelease` method to create a new release. The method takes in various parameters such as the repository information, tag name, release name, release body, draft status, prerelease status, and target commit SHA. The response from the API call is logged to the console and the resulting release object is assigned to the `releaseResult` variable.\n\nIf an existing release is found but it is not in draft mode, an error message is logged and the process is exited with a status code of 1.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `releaseResult` object, which represents the created or existing release.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to automate the release creation process for a GitHub repository. It can be integrated into a GitHub Actions workflow to trigger the release creation whenever a new tag is pushed to the repository. The resulting release can then be used to publish the project's changelog, distribute assets, or perform other release-related tasks.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It interacts with the GitHub API to find a release with a specific tag, downloads the associated npm package asset, and then runs the `npm publish` command to publish the package.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. The script imports necessary modules such as `execFileSync` from the `child_process` module, `fs` for file system operations, `fetch` and `stream` from the `undici` module for making HTTP requests, and `sade` for creating a command-line interface.\n\n2. The script defines a `DEBUG` variable and a `log` object with methods for logging debug, info, and error messages. The `DEBUG` variable is initially set to `false`.\n\n3. The script defines an `async` function called `main` that takes in a `tag` and `opts` parameter. The `tag` parameter represents the tag of the release to publish, and the `opts` parameter represents additional options passed to the script.\n\n4. Inside the `main` function, the `DEBUG` variable is updated based on the value of `opts.debug`.\n\n5. The script makes an HTTP request to the GitHub API to retrieve information about a release with the specified `tag`. If the response status is 404, it means that the release was not found and an error message is logged. If the response status is not ok, an error message is logged with the status and status text. If the response is successful, the release information is parsed from the response JSON.\n\n6. The script checks if a release was found. If a release is found, an info message is logged. If a release is not found, an error message is logged.\n\n7. The script searches for an npm package release asset in the release assets. It uses a regular expression to match assets with names that start with \"preact-\" and end with \".tgz\". If a matching asset is found, an info message is logged. If a matching asset is not found, an error message is logged.\n\n8. The script downloads the release asset using the `stream` function from the `undici` module. The asset's browser download URL is used as the source URL for the stream, and a write stream is created to save the downloaded asset.\n\n9. The script runs the `npm publish` command using the `execFileSync` function from the `child_process` module. The command is executed with the provided package asset name as an argument. If the `--npm-tag` option is provided, it is also passed as an argument. If the `--dry-run` option is provided, the command is not actually executed.\n\n10. The script uses the `sade` module to create a command-line interface. The `publish` command is defined with a required `git-tag` argument. Additional options such as `--npm-tag`, `--dry-run`, and `--debug` are defined. The `main` function is set as the action to be executed when the `publish` command is run.\n\nIn the larger Preact project, this script can be used by developers to easily publish tagged versions of the Preact package to npm. It automates the process of retrieving release information, downloading the associated npm package asset, and running the `npm publish` command. Developers can provide additional options such as the npm tag and enable debugging if needed.\n## Questions: \n 1. What does the `main` function do and what are its parameters? \nThe `main` function is an asynchronous function that takes in a `tag` (string) and `opts` (any) as parameters. It is responsible for fetching a release from GitHub, finding the npm package release asset, downloading the asset, and running `npm publish`.\n\n2. How does the code handle errors when fetching the release from GitHub? \nIf the response status is 404, it logs an error message indicating that the GitHub release for the specified tag could not be found. If the response status is not ok, it logs the GitHub API error and exits the process.\n\n3. How does the code determine the npm package release asset? \nThe code loops through the assets of the release and checks if the asset name matches the regex pattern `/^preact-.+\\.tgz$/`. If a matching asset is found, it assigns it to the `packageAsset` variable.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/scripts/release/publish.md"}}],["118",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/scripts/release/upload-gh-asset.js)\n\nThe code provided is a function called `upload` that is responsible for uploading a release artifact to a GitHub repository. It takes in an object `params` as a parameter, which contains various dependencies and information needed for the upload process.\n\nThe function first imports the `fs` module using the `require` function. This module is used to read the contents of the release artifact file.\n\nNext, it defines an `artifactPattern` variable which represents the pattern to match the release artifact file. In this case, it is set to `'preact.tgz'`. It then uses the `glob` module to create a globber object that matches the artifact pattern. The `globber` object is used to search for files that match the pattern.\n\nThe function then calls the `globber.glob()` method to get the results of the glob search. If no files are found, an error is thrown indicating that no release artifact was found. If more than one file is found, an error is thrown indicating that only one file was expected.\n\nIf only one file is found, the function proceeds to define the `assetPath` variable which represents the path to the release artifact file. It also defines the `assetName` variable which is derived from the release tag name. The `assetRegex` variable is a regular expression pattern used to match existing assets in the release.\n\nThe function then iterates over the existing assets in the release and checks if their names match the `assetRegex` pattern. If a match is found, the asset is deleted using the `github.rest.repos.deleteReleaseAsset()` method.\n\nAfter deleting any existing assets, the function logs a message indicating that the artifact is being uploaded. It then uses the `github.rest.repos.uploadReleaseAsset()` method to upload the release artifact. The `release_id` and `name` parameters are used to specify the release and the name of the asset, respectively. The `data` parameter is set to the contents of the release artifact file read using the `fs.readFileSync()` method.\n\nFinally, the function logs the response data from the upload request and returns the response data.\n\nThis `upload` function is likely used as part of a larger project to automate the release process for the Preact project. It provides a convenient way to upload release artifacts to a GitHub repository, ensuring that only one artifact with a specific name exists in the release.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This check is used to determine if the code is running in a CommonJS environment, such as Node.js. If this condition is true, the code exports the `preact` variable as the module's export using the `module.exports` statement. This allows other modules to import and use the `preact` variable.\n\nIf the condition is false, it means that the code is running in a non-CommonJS environment, such as a browser. In this case, the code assigns the `preact` variable to the `self.preact` property. The `self` object refers to the global object in a browser environment, such as `window`. This allows the `preact` variable to be accessed globally in the browser.\n\nOverall, this code ensures that the Preact library can be used in different environments by exporting it as a module in CommonJS environments and assigning it to the global object in non-CommonJS environments.

It takes three parameters: `vnode`, `props`, and `children`. \n\nThe `vnode` parameter represents the virtual DOM element that needs to be cloned. \n\nThe `props` parameter is an object that contains the attributes or props to be added when cloning the VNode. \n\nThe `children` parameter is an array of replacement children that will replace the children of the cloned VNode. \n\nThe function starts by creating a shallow copy of the `vnode.props` object using the `assign` function from the `./util` module. This ensures that any modifications made to the `normalizedProps` object do not affect the original `vnode.props` object. \n\nNext, the function checks if the `vnode` has a `type` property and if that `type` has `defaultProps`. If so, it assigns the `defaultProps` to the `normalizedProps` object. \n\nThen, the function iterates over the `props` object and checks each property. If the property is `'key'`, it assigns the value to the `key` variable. If the property is `'ref'`, it assigns the value to the `ref` variable. If the property is `undefined` and `defaultProps` is not `undefined`, it assigns the corresponding `defaultProps` value to the `normalizedProps` object. Otherwise, it assigns the property value to the `normalizedProps` object. \n\nAfter that, the function checks if there are more than two arguments passed to the function. If so, it assigns the replacement children to the `normalizedProps.children` property. If there are more than three arguments, it uses the `slice` function from the `./util` module to convert the arguments after the third argument into an array and assigns it to `normalizedProps.children`. \n\nFinally, the function calls the `createVNode` function from the `./create-element` module to create a new VNode with the cloned `vnode.type`, `normalizedProps`, `key`, `ref`, and `null` as the last argument. The newly created VNode is then returned. \n\nThis `cloneElement` function can be used in the larger Preact project to create clones of VNodes with modified attributes or props and replacement children. This can be useful when dynamically updating the virtual DOM and reusing existing VNodes with slight modifications. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { cloneElement } from 'preact';\n\nconst originalVNode = <div class=\"original\">Original VNode</div>;\n\nconst clonedVNode = cloneElement(originalVNode, { class: 'modified' }, 'Modified VNode');\n\nconsole.log(clonedVNode);\n// Output: <div class=\"modified\">Modified VNode</div>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `cloneElement` function is used to create a clone of the `originalVNode` with the `class` attribute modified to `'modified'` and the children replaced with the string `'Modified VNode'`. The resulting `clonedVNode` is then logged to the console.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `cloneElement` function?**\nThe `cloneElement` function is used to create a clone of a given virtual DOM element (`vnode`), optionally adding attributes/props and replacing its children.\n\n2. **What does the `normalizedProps` variable represent?**\nThe `normalizedProps` variable is an object that contains the attributes/props of the cloned virtual DOM element (`vnode`), with any additional props from the `props` argument added or replaced.\n\n3. **What happens if the `props` argument contains a `key` or `ref` property?**\nIf the `props` argument contains a `key` property, it will be assigned to the `key` variable.

It also includes a `render()` method that returns a new Virtual DOM tree to build.\n\nThe `setState()` method allows the component to update its state and schedule a re-render. It takes an `update` parameter, which can be either a hash of state properties to update with new values or a function that returns a new partial state. The method clones the current state and assigns the updated values to it. If the `update` parameter is a function, it is called with the current state and props to generate the new state. The method then assigns the updated state to the component's `_nextState` property and enqueues a render using the `enqueueRender()` function.\n\nThe `forceUpdate()` method triggers an immediate synchronous re-render of the component. It sets a flag `_force` to indicate that the render request is coming from `forceUpdate()`. The method enqueues a render using the `enqueueRender()` function.\n\nThe `render()` method is responsible for returning a new Virtual DOM tree to build. It takes `props`, `state`, and `context` as parameters and returns the component's rendered output. In the provided code, the `render()` method returns a `Fragment`, which is a special type of component that allows multiple children to be rendered without a wrapper element.\n\nThe `enqueueRender()` function is used to enqueue a rerender of a component. It takes a component `c` as a parameter and adds it to the `rerenderQueue` array. If the component is not already marked as dirty, it sets the `_dirty` flag to `true` and increments the `process._rerenderCount` variable. It then checks if the `options.debounceRendering` value has changed since the last call and if so, schedules the `process()` function to be called asynchronously.\n\nThe `process()` function is responsible for flushing the render queue by rerendering all the queued components. It sorts the `rerenderQueue` array based on the depth of the components' virtual nodes and then iterates over the array, calling the `renderComponent()` function for each component. After rendering a component, it checks if any new components have been added to the `rerenderQueue` array and sorts it again if necessary. Finally, it resets the `process._rerenderCount` variable to `0`.\n\nOverall, this code provides the basic functionality for components in Preact, allowing them to update their state, trigger re-renders, and render their output. It also includes a mechanism for batching and scheduling renders to optimize performance.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It takes an object or a function as an argument to update the state, and an optional callback function to be called after the state is updated.\n\n2. How does the `forceUpdate()` function work and when should it be used?\n- The `forceUpdate()` function triggers an immediate synchronous re-render of the component. It should be used when the component needs to be re-rendered even if the state or props haven't changed.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `enqueueRender()` function and how does it work?\n- The `enqueueRender()` function is used to enqueue a rerender of a component.

It provides a way to share data between components without the need for props drilling.\n\nThe `createContext` function takes two parameters: `defaultValue` and `contextId`. The `defaultValue` parameter is the value that will be used if no provider is found in the component tree. The `contextId` parameter is used to uniquely identify the context object.\n\nInside the `createContext` function, a context object is created with the following properties:\n\n- `_id`: This property is set to the `contextId` parameter.\n- `_defaultValue`: This property is set to the `defaultValue` parameter.\n\nThe context object also has two methods:\n\n- `Consumer`: This method is a functional component that takes two parameters: `props` and `contextValue`. It renders the `children` prop and passes the `contextValue` as an argument to the `children` function. This allows components to consume the context value.\n- `Provider`: This method is a functional component that takes a `props` parameter. It checks if the `getChildContext` method is defined. If not, it creates an empty object `ctx` and sets the `contextId` property of the `ctx` object to `this` (referring to the current component instance). It then defines the `getChildContext` method to return the `ctx` object. It also defines the `shouldComponentUpdate` method to check if the `value` prop has changed. If it has, it sets the `_force` property of each subscribed component to `true` and enqueues a render for each component. Finally, it defines the `sub` method to add a component to the list of subscribed components and handles the removal of the component when it is unmounted.\n\nThe `createContext` function also sets the `context.Provider._contextRef` and `context.Consumer.contextType` properties to the context object. This is done to provide access to the context object for devtools and to support setting the `displayName` on the context object instead of on the component itself.\n\nOverall, the `createContext` function is used to create a context object in Preact that can be used to share data between components in a component tree.\n## Questions: \n 1.

If it has, it triggers a re-render of the component and its children.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/src/create-context.md"}}],["124",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/src/create-element.js)\n\nThe code provided is part of the Preact project and is responsible for creating virtual nodes and validating Preact VNodes.\n\nThe `createElement` function is used to create a virtual node (VNode) in Preact. It takes three parameters: `type`, `props`, and `children`. The `type` parameter can be either a node name or a component constructor. The `props` parameter is an object that represents the properties of the virtual node. The `children` parameter is an array of component children. The function then normalizes the props by separating the `key` and `ref` properties from the rest of the props. If there are more than two arguments passed to the function, it assigns the children to the `normalizedProps.children` property. If the `type` parameter is a component VNode and has `defaultProps`, the function applies those default props to the `normalizedProps` object. Finally, the function calls the `createVNode` function to create the VNode with the normalized props, key, ref, and null for the original parameter.\n\nThe `createVNode` function is used internally by Preact to create a VNode. It takes four parameters: `type`, `props`, `key`, `ref`, and `original`. It creates a VNode object with the provided parameters and initializes other properties such as `_children`, `_parent`, `_depth`, `_dom`, `_nextDom`, `_component`, `_hydrating`, `constructor`, and `_original`. If the `original` parameter is null, it assigns a unique ID to the `_original` property. If the `options.vnode` hook is defined and the `original` parameter is null, it invokes the `options.vnode` hook with the created VNode as the argument.\n\nThe `createRef` function is used to create a reference object with a `current` property set to null. This reference object can be used to store a reference to a DOM element or a component instance.\n\nThe `Fragment` function is a component that simply returns its children. It is used to group multiple elements together without introducing an additional DOM node.\n\nThe `isValidElement` function is used to check if a given argument is a valid Preact VNode. It returns true if the argument is not null and its constructor is undefined.\n\nOverall, this code provides the necessary functions to create and validate virtual nodes in Preact, which is a lightweight alternative to React for building user interfaces. These functions are essential for rendering components and managing the virtual DOM in the larger Preact project.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `createElement` function?\n- The `createElement` function is used to create a virtual node (VNode) in Preact, which is used for JSX.\n\n2. What is the difference between `createElement` and `createVNode`?\n- `createElement` is a public function that is used to create a VNode with normalized props and children, while `createVNode` is an internal function that creates a VNode with specific properties like type, props, key, ref, etc.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `isValidElement` function?\n- The `isValidElement` function is used to check if a given argument is a valid Preact VNode. It returns true if the argument is a VNode and false otherwise.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/src/create-element.md"}}],["125",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/src/diff/catch-error.js)\n\nThe code provided is a function called `_catchError` that is used to find the closest error boundary to a thrown error and call it. \n\nThe function takes four parameters:\n- `error`: The thrown value, which represents the error that was thrown.\n- `vnode`: The vnode (virtual node) that threw the error. This parameter is used to track the hierarchy of vnodes and find the closest error boundary.\n- `oldVNode`: An optional parameter that represents the previous vnode. It is not used in the code provided.\n- `errorInfo`: An optional parameter that represents additional information about the error. It is not used in the code provided.\n\nThe function starts by declaring three variables: `component`, `ctor`, and `handled`. These variables will be used to track the component, its constructor, and whether the error has been handled.\n\nThe function then enters a loop that iterates through the parent vnodes of the current vnode. This loop allows the function to traverse up the vnode hierarchy and find the closest error boundary.\n\nInside the loop, the function checks if the current vnode has a component and if it has not already processed an exception. If these conditions are met, the function tries to handle the error by calling `getDerivedStateFromError` and `componentDidCatch` methods on the component.\n\nIf the component has a `getDerivedStateFromError` method, the function calls it with the `error` parameter and sets the state of the component with the returned value. The `handled` variable is then set to `true` if the component's state has been updated.\n\nIf the component has a `componentDidCatch` method, the function calls it with the `error` and `errorInfo` parameters. The `handled` variable is again set to `true` if the component's state has been updated.\n\nAfter handling the error, the function checks if the error has been handled. If it has, the function sets the `_pendingError` property of the component to itself and returns the component.\n\nIf an error occurs while handling the error, the function catches the error and assigns it to the `error` variable. This allows the function to continue searching for an error boundary in the vnode hierarchy.\n\nIf no error boundary is found in the vnode hierarchy, the function throws the original error.\n\nIn the larger project, this function is likely used as part of the error handling mechanism in the Preact library. When an error occurs during rendering or updating of components, this function is called to find the closest error boundary and handle the error appropriately. This helps prevent the entire application from crashing and allows for graceful error handling and recovery.\n## Questions: \n 1.

If these conditions are met, the `setProperty` function is called with the property set to `null` to remove it from the DOM node.\n\nNext, the function iterates over the new properties and checks if the property is not 'children', 'key', 'value', 'checked', and if the oldProps value is not equal to the newProps value. If these conditions are met, the `setProperty` function is called to set the new property value on the DOM node.\n\nThe `setProperty` function is responsible for setting a property value on a DOM node. It takes in parameters such as `dom` (the DOM node to modify), `name` (the name of the property to set), `value` (the value to set the property to), `oldValue` (the old value of the property), and `isSvg` (a boolean indicating whether the DOM node is an SVG node).\n\nThe function first checks if the property name is 'style'. If it is, it handles setting the style property of the DOM node. If the value is a string, it sets the `cssText` property of the `style` object of the DOM node to the value. If the value is an object, it iterates over the properties of the `oldValue` object and removes any properties that are not present in the `value` object. Then, it iterates over the properties of the `value` object and sets each property on the `style` object of the DOM node.\n\nIf the property name starts with 'o' and the second character is 'n', it handles event listeners. It checks if the property name needs to be normalized and sets the event listener on the DOM node accordingly.\n\nIf the property name is not 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML', it handles setting other properties on the DOM node. It checks if the DOM node is an SVG node and normalizes the property name if necessary. It also checks if the property name is a valid property for the DOM node and sets the property value accordingly.\n\nOverall, this code is responsible for updating the properties of a DOM node based on the changes in the Virtual DOM.

These types and interfaces are used to define the structure and behavior of components in Preact.\n\nThe code then defines the `Component` abstract class, which serves as the base class for all Preact components. It includes various lifecycle methods and properties that can be overridden or implemented by derived classes.\n\nNext, the code defines the `createElement` and `h` functions, which are used to create virtual DOM nodes in Preact.

The `render` function is used for initial rendering, while the `hydrate` function is used for re-rendering components that were previously rendered on the server.\n\nThe `createElement` function is exported twice, once as `createElement` and once as `h`. This function is responsible for creating virtual DOM elements in Preact. It takes in a tag name or component, an optional set of props, and any number of child elements.

It is a crucial part of the error handling mechanism in Preact.\n\nBy exporting the `options` object, other modules in the Preact project can import and use it to customize the behavior of the renderer. For example, the `preact/debug` addon module may import the `options` object and add its own callback functions to enable debugging features. Similarly, other addons like `preact/compat` and `preact/hooks` can also use the `options` object to extend the functionality of Preact.\n\nHere is an example of how the `options` object can be used in another module:\n\n```javascript\nimport options from 'Preact';\n\n// Add a custom callback function to the options object\noptions.customCallback = () => {\n  // Custom logic here\n};\n\n// Use the options object to configure the Preact renderer\nPreact.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'), options);\n```\n\nIn this example, a custom callback function `customCallback` is added to the `options` object.

These functions are responsible for rendering Preact virtual nodes into the DOM.\n\nThe `render` function takes three parameters: `vnode`, `parentDom`, and an optional `replaceNode`. The `vnode` parameter represents the virtual node to be rendered, `parentDom` represents the DOM element to render into, and `replaceNode` is used to attempt reusing an existing DOM tree rooted at `replaceNode`. \n\nThe function starts by checking if there is a root option defined in the `options` object. If so, it calls the root option function with the `vnode` and `parentDom` as arguments. \n\nNext, it determines whether the rendering is in hydration mode by checking if the `replaceNode` parameter is a function. If it is, then hydration mode is enabled. \n\nTo support multiple calls to `render()` on the same DOM node, the function needs to obtain a reference to the previous tree. It does this by assigning a new `_children` property to DOM nodes, which points to the last rendered tree. If there is no previous tree, it sets `oldVNode` to `null`.\n\nThe `vnode` is then assigned to `parentDom._children` or `replaceNode._children` to store the new vnode tree on the DOM element.\n\nThe function then calls the `diff` function, passing the necessary parameters to perform the diffing process. The `diff` function compares the new vnode tree with the old vnode tree and determines the differences between them. It creates a list of effects that need to be called after the diffing process.\n\nFinally, the `commitRoot` function is called to flush all the queued effects and update the DOM with the changes.\n\nThe `hydrate` function is a wrapper around the `render` function. It takes the same parameters and calls the `render` function with an additional `hydrate` parameter. This parameter is used to signal that hydration mode is enabled.\n\nIn summary, these functions are essential for rendering Preact virtual nodes into the DOM. They handle the diffing process and update the DOM efficiently. The `render` function is used for initial rendering, while the `hydrate` function is used for re-rendering with existing DOM elements.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It uses the `Array.isArray` method to perform this check. This function can be used throughout the project to handle array-related operations.\n\nThe second function, `assign`, is a utility function that copies properties from one object to another. It takes two parameters: `obj` and `props`. The `obj` parameter is the object to which the properties will be copied, and the `props` parameter is the object from which the properties will be copied. The function iterates over the properties of the `props` object and assigns them to the `obj` object. This function can be used to merge properties from different objects into a single object.\n\nThe third function, `removeNode`, is a workaround for the lack of support for the `Element.prototype.remove()` method in IE11. It takes a `node` parameter, which is the node to be removed from its parent. The function checks if the node has a parent node and, if it does, removes the node from its parent. This function can be used to safely remove nodes from the DOM in a cross-browser compatible way.\n\nThe last line of code exports the `slice` method from the `EMPTY_ARR` constant. This allows other modules in the project to use the `slice` method from the `EMPTY_ARR` array. This can be useful for performing array slicing operations.\n\nOverall, this module provides utility functions that can be used throughout the Preact project for array-related operations, property assignment, and safe node removal. These functions help improve code reusability and maintainability in the project.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `assign` function?\n- The `assign` function is used to copy properties from one object (`props`) to another object (`obj`).\n\n2. Why is there a `@ts-ignore` comment in the `assign` function?\n- The `@ts-ignore` comment is used to ignore TypeScript type checking for the line where the type of `obj` is changed to be `O & P`.\n\n3.
