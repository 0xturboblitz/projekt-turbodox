  "summary": "The code provided is a function called `addHookName` that is used to customize the displayed name of a `useState`, `useReducer`, or `useRef` hook in the devtools panel. \n\nHooks are a feature in React that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components. The `useState`, `useReducer`, and `useRef` hooks are commonly used hooks in React.\n\nThe purpose of this function is to provide a way for developers to give a custom name to these hooks when they are displayed in the devtools panel. By default, the devtools panel displays the name of the hook function itself, but this function allows developers to override that default name with a custom name of their choosing.\n\nThe function takes two parameters: `value` and `name`. The `value` parameter represents the wrapped native hook, which can be either a `useState`, `useReducer`, or `useRef` hook. The `name` parameter is the custom name that the developer wants to assign to the hook.\n\nThe function returns the same `value` that was passed in, but with the custom name applied. This allows the developer to continue using the hook with the custom name in their code.\n\nHere is an example of how this function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { addHookName } from 'Preact';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const customState = addHookName(useState('initial'), 'customState');\n\n  // The customState hook will now be displayed as 'customState' in the devtools panel\n  // instead of 'useState'\n  \n  return (\n    // ...\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useState` hook is wrapped with the `addHookName` function and given the custom name `'customState'`. As a result, when the component is inspected in the devtools panel, the hook will be displayed as `'customState'` instead of `'useState'`. This can be useful for providing more descriptive names for hooks, especially in larger projects where there may be many hooks used.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this function?**\nThis function is used to customize the displayed name of a useState, useReducer, or useRef hook in the devtools panel.\n\n2. **What are the parameters of this function?**\nThe function takes two parameters: `value`, which is the wrapped native hook, and `name`, which is the custom name that will be displayed in the devtools panel.\n\n3. **What is the return type of this function?**\nThe return type of this function is the same as the type of the `value` parameter."
