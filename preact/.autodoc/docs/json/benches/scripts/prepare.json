  "summary": "The code provided is a function called `prepare` that is used to prepare proxy packages for a given list of frameworks. \n\nThe function starts by defining the root directory for the proxy packages using the `repoRoot` function from the `utils.js` file. It then reads the contents of the proxy packages directory using the `readdir` function from the `fs/promises` module. The resulting array of directory names is then mapped to remove the \"-proxy\" suffix from each name.\n\nNext, the function iterates over each framework in the input `frameworks` array. For each framework, it checks if there is a corresponding directory in the proxy packages directory. If there is no matching directory, the function continues to the next framework.\n\nIf a matching directory is found, the function defines a helper function called `proxyDir` that returns the path to the specific proxy package directory for the current framework.\n\nThe function then checks if the proxy package has a `scripts.mjs` file using the `existsSync` function from the `fs` module. If the file exists, it is imported and the `preinstall` function is called if it exists.\n\nNext, the function deletes the `package-lock.json` file and the `node_modules` folder from the proxy package directory using the `deleteAsync` function from the `del` module. This is done to ensure that the latest packages are always installed.\n\nAfter cleaning the directory, the function runs the `npm i` command using the `execFileSync` function from the `child_process` module. This command installs the dependencies for the proxy package.\n\nIf the proxy package has a `scripts.mjs` file, it is imported again and the `postinstall` function is called if it exists.\n\nIn summary, the `prepare` function prepares proxy packages for a list of frameworks by cleaning the package directory, installing the latest packages, and running pre and post-install scripts if they exist. This function is likely used as part of a larger project to set up the necessary dependencies for running benchmarks or tests on different frameworks.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `prepare` function?\n- The `prepare` function is used to prepare proxy packages for specified frameworks by performing various tasks such as cleaning directories, installing dependencies, and running pre and post-install scripts.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `proxyDirs` variable?\n- The `proxyDirs` variable is an array that contains the names of the directories within the `proxyRoot` directory. These directories are used to identify the proxy packages for the specified frameworks.\n\n3. Why is the `package-lock.json` file and `node_modules` folder deleted before running `npm i`?\n- The `package-lock.json` file and `node_modules` folder are deleted to ensure that the latest packages are installed. This is necessary because npm may cache locally referenced tarball files and not use the local tarball file even if it has changed or is deleted."
