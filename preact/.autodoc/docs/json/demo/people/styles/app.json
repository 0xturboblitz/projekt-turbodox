  "summary": "The code provided is a CSS stylesheet that defines the styling for a component or section of a web application called \"people-app\". The purpose of this code is to define the visual appearance and layout of the \"people-app\" component.\n\nThe \"people-app\" component is a container element that represents a section of the larger web application. It has a relative positioning and a minimum height of 100vh (viewport height), which ensures that it takes up at least the full height of the viewport. It also has an animation called \"popup\" that lasts for 300ms and uses a cubic-bezier timing function. This animation is applied when the component is displayed or shown.\n\nThe component has a background color defined by the CSS variable \"--app-background\". It also defines two CSS variables \"--menu-width\" and \"--menu-item-height\" that can be used to control the width and height of the menu within the component.\n\nInside the \"people-app\" component, there is a nested \"nav\" element that represents a navigation menu. The \"nav\" element has a fixed width defined by the \"--menu-width\" variable and a height of 100%. It has a background color defined by the CSS variable \"--app-background-secondary\". The menu items within the navigation menu are displayed vertically and can be scrolled if they overflow the available space.\n\nEach menu item is represented by an \"li\" element and has a width of 100%. The menu items have a zoom animation that lasts for 200ms and is applied when they are displayed. They also have a transparent border and rounded corners. When a menu item is hovered over, it changes its background color to \"--app-highlight\".\n\nThe menu items also have a pseudo-element \"::after\" that is positioned on top of the menu item. This pseudo-element has a radial gradient background that creates a ripple effect when the menu item is clicked. The ripple effect is achieved by changing the size and opacity of the pseudo-element.\n\nThe \"people-main\" element is a sibling of the \"nav\" element and represents the main content area of the \"people-app\" component. It has a left padding equal to the width of the navigation menu, which ensures that the content is not obscured by the menu.\n\nIn summary, this code defines the visual appearance and layout of a component called \"people-app\" in a web application. It includes a navigation menu with styled menu items and a main content area. The code can be used to style and layout the \"people-app\" component within the larger project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `animation` property in the `#people-app` selector?\n- The `animation` property is used to apply a CSS animation called \"popup\" to the `#people-app` element, with a duration of 300ms and a specific cubic-bezier timing function.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `@media (min-width: 1280px)` rule?\n- The `@media (min-width: 1280px)` rule sets specific styles for the `#people-app` element when the viewport width is equal to or greater than 1280px.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `> nav li > a::after` selector?\n- The `> nav li > a::after` selector is used to add a radial gradient background effect to the `a` elements within the `li` elements inside the `nav` element."
